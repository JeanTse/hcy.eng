{"posts":[{"title":"Why Nobody Fights","text":"1. About the songReleased on August 15 2014. Toward the end of June 2014, when work on the album Quasimodo’s Gift was in its final stages, Hua Chenyu wrote “Why Nobody Fights” which was inspired by a most unlikely source. In an interview, Hua stated that the inspiration for this song came after watching a soccer match during his travels in Europe. He wanted to dedicate the song to his audience to encourage them to be true to themselves. Hua Chenyu takes great pride in the fact that he wrote the only line of lyrics in this song. He has only one other lyricist credit in his four-album repertoire. With each repetition of that line (why nobody fights), the delivery is slightly different. As a result, recording it wasn’t easy and it took several days. Bernard Zheng, now Hua’s long-time producer, recruited the renowned American mixing engineer, music producer, and multi-instrumentalist, Ken Lewis for the downmixing. Zheng initially invited some friends to sing the chorus, which in a concert setting would be sung by the audience. However, after listening to the rough cut, Hua felt that it was too perfect and decided to go in a different direction. To create the mysterious “choir-inspired” feeling that he wanted, many people would need to participate. Hua then recommended inviting his fans to participate. One hundred fans gathered at a large orchestral recording studio to complete the accompaniment and achieve the dramatic choral effect he had hoped for. 2.

About the songReleased in 2014. The interlude music for the TV drama “My Sunshine (何以笙箫默)”.This song is included in the first album “Quasimodo’s Gift“. “Glimmer” just like its name, is a soft and gentle song performed with exceptional tenderness by Hua Chenyu. A piano accompaniment is all that’s needed as he sings this simple melody. The music is sometimes quiet, sometimes it swells. “Glimmer” is intricate and intense, but without the rock edge and technical high notes Hua is known for. This delicate arrangement highlights the beauty and power of Hua Chenyu’s voice and demonstrates his careful control. Still, Hua permits the subtle emotion of the song to shine, which allows the listener to feel that glimmer of light. On April 20, 2018, Hua Chenyu performed this iconic piece during the post-festival of the music competition program “[Singer 2018](/Singer 2018/)” He also had collaborations with the Chinese pianist Lang Lang in various performances. On September 25, 2022, during the online concert “火星乐章 (Mars Chapter)“ celebrating his 9th debut anniversary, Hua Chenyu arranged 11 songs in collaboration with a symphony orchestra and choir. 2.

About the songReleased on August 29 2014. As soon as Hua Chenyu arrived home one day, he sat down at the piano and began to compose. “Let You Go” was the result. Beginning with the first harmony, the melody was already established, and Hua Chenyu was able to record the music as he played and sang. In his own words, it was “a song written in a song’s time.” After listening to the demo, Hua’s producer Bernard Zheng agreed that the chords he used and the emphatic way he sang “let you go” in English suited the electronic rock style. The arrangement of the song has two distinct parts; the first part of the song has the feeling of restraint, which allows the listener to focus on the vocals and the simple piano accompaniment. In the second part of the song, the restraint fades and energy begins to build. The long introduction creates a feeling of suppression until the end of the interlude where, following the rhythm of the drums and the incorporation of other instruments and electronic sounds, the tones are built and layered to create a theatrical conflict. The singer’s words in Chinese and English, “let you go, 别靠近我 (stay away from me),” intensifies that contrast. During audio mixing, Ken Lewis minimized the rock elements of the song, strengthening instead the electronic components, and finally toning down the guitar. 2.

About the songReleased on August 26, 2014. “Bomb Squad” was another composition by Danish indie rock band Dúné and arranged by Dúné and Bernard Zheng. Zhao Zhisheng, a young lyricist, wrote the rebellious and humorous lyrics. The style of the song is indie rock with imaginative, catchy lyrics. Vocals throughout the song are high-pitched and are accompanied by a chorus of children’s voices along with repeated rhythmic drumming and clapping sound effects. These stylings make the song novel, interesting, and easy for Martians to sing along with. 2. VideosMars Concert 2019 FanCam Mars Concert 2016 Official Video 3.

About the songReleased on August 26, 2014. After listening to the demo for “Ashes From Fireworks”, Hua Chenyu felt that the delicate melody was quite suitable for his voice and decided to include it in this album. Xi Lou wrote the song in 2012 to comfort himself while going through a difficult time. The song was similar to the deeply personal song, “I Am What I Am“, covered by Hua Chenyu during the Super Boy 2013 competition. “Ashes From Fireworks” was not the typical kind of song that people were used to hearing. When Bernard Zheng received the demo for “Ashes From Fireworks”, he felt it was a fortuitous coincidence as he knew the composer, Xi Lou. Zheng felt that he and Hua Chenyu shared a common understanding of music, so in order to preserve the original feeling of the song, he asked Xi Lou to help with the arrangement. Xi not only helped complete the second arrangement of the song, but ultimately stayed throughout the entire recording process. This process included five mixing modifications and Xi also recorded the harmony. In keeping with the conceptual ideas of the album, the theme of “smoke” was used throughout the arrangement and lyrics. Albert Leung, a judge for the 2014 Spring Festival Gala, was deeply impressed by Hua’s singing in the competition. Leung was invited and immediately agreed to write lyrics for this album. In preparation for writing, he watched many videos and read many articles about Hua. Following the official recording, Leung changed the lyrics for “Ashes From Fireworks” an additional three times to ensure they represented the true feeling of Hua Chenyu’s inner world, and also to ensure they conformed to his high standards. In order to achieve the desired psychedelic effect of time and space, Hua Chenyu recorded the song so many times that he became hoarse. The end result was that the song appeared to be much easier to sing than it actually was. 2. VideosMV “Mars Chapter” Symphony Shanghai Zebra Music Festival 2018 3.

About the songReleased on September 19, 2014. “Traveling” is one of several songs chosen by Hua Chenyu which were composed by the Danish band, Dúné. He liked their songs so much that he actually chose four for his first album. The vocals, sound effects, and instrumentation come together to make “Traveling” sound ethereal, transparent, and psychedelic; as though traveling in outer space. The lyrics describe a journey through life where Hua Chenyu encourages listeners to follow that journey with courage and youthful vitality. The song conveys the positive energy of youth, a new generation of rock style in comparison to the previous heavy and rather angry expression of the former generation. The studio version incorporates a multitude of electronic sound effects, and although perhaps not as popular as “Ashes From Fireworks“ or “I Don’t Care“, “Traveling” is an extremely challenging song to sing with a wide range and many different transitions from one register to another. 2.

About the songReleased on September 19, 2014. A somber melody and uncomplicated lyrics bring a kind of dark mood to this song. It portrays a truth that resonates deep in the heart: we are all lonely. At some point in our lives we all feel alone, our dreams lost, invisible, and unappreciated. We feel the singer’s heartbreak as he exposes his pain. His voice weeps as he describes the falling rain and the lonely road home. The interlude transports us there with him as the sound of the wailing guitar and the singer’s dejected tone accompany us. As the song ends, we feel a final sigh in the gentle tones of the piano and guitar. 2. VideosMars Concert 2016 Official Video 3.

About the songReleased on September 17, 2014. “Immortal” is another song originally composed by indie rock band Dúné and chosen by Hua Chenyu. Given that song selection was made from over 20,000 demos, it’s clear that Hua truly loves the music of this band, as he chose several of their songs in this first album. The fast-paced musical style of “Immortal” is metal, rhythmic, and rocky. There are distinct stylistic differences between the more electronic verses and the rock-style chorus. Bernard Zheng’s arrangement emphasized the guitar segments with a very interesting interlude. The vocals are challenging for the singer, as they are high in the treble range with explosive segments. Hua Hua received praise from the sound engineers during the recording process as he was not only able to sing in that high range for many hours at a time, but also returned the next day rested and able to give his best. The young and wild attitude of the song arises from the combination of melody, instrumentation and Hua’s powerful singing. The wonderful lyrics composed by Guo De Ziyi are determined, proud and unyielding; echoed by the wild cries of a princely, passionate young man. 2. VideosMV Mars Concert 2016 Official Video 3.

About the songReleased on September 12, 2014. Hua Chenyu’s inspiration for “Quasimodo’s Gift” came after seeing an abstract painting in a church in Italy during the European tour of the reality television show “Divas Hit the Road (花儿与少年)“. At that time, because of the program’s regulations, mobile phones had to be turned in to the producers; as a result, he had no device on which to record the melody. After returning to China, he explained that he was not able to remember the melody, but two months later while composing songs for his album, he suddenly recalled that painting and immediately recorded the music on the piano. When writing this song, the picture in Hua Chenyu’s mind was of a church at night, with a lonely sufferer kneeling in front of a single candle. “Quasimodo’s Gift” is in some ways classical in style, but is still infused with popular musical elements. Bernard Zheng produced the music so that the painful feelings evoked by the demo became more beautiful and sad. He also included the sounds one would experience on a dark and rainy night, such as thunder, lightening, and church bells. These environmental sounds immediately bring to mind a lonely singer in the dark. It took Hua Chenyu only about two hours to record this song. 2. VideosShort Movie MV “Mars Chapter” Symphony 3.

About the songReleased on September 19, 2014. “Bedtime Story” is not what you would call a “big” song, with only a guitar for accompaniment; however, the lyrics are simple and touching. They relate the fairy tale story of a princess who falls in love with a frog, marries him against the family objections, and then they go away to live happily ever after. The novice songwriter, Ronald Tsui, spent a few years in the UK and was influenced by 90s pop, R&amp;B, and soul, but was focused on two things; simplicity and love. The writer of the lyrics in Chinese, Dai Yuedong, emailed them in the middle of the night to Hua, laughingly pointing out the frogs, the prince, and the fairy tale-like aspects of the subject matter. It was love at first sight for Hua Hua. 2. VideosMars Concert 2016 Official Video 3.

About the songFirst released at Mars Concert 2018 on September 8, 2018.Officially released on September 12, 2014. As a hard-hitting track in Hua Chenyu’s fourth solo album “NEW WORLD“, expresses a unique perspective on the debate of mankind’s relationship with nature and the awe and respect towards the vigorous tenacity of life. and a discussion of the relationship between man and nature and awe of life and natural forces with a different philosophical perspective. This is a song that portrays the philosophical complexion of recurrent natural forces and a song that conveys encompassing love towards all life. His writing of is the longest period Hua Chenyu had taken to compose a song. It took an entire month in alternating bursts of intense composing at the piano and long periods of rest and clearing of his mind. The lyrics describe the barbarity of mankind in contrast with the pureness of an untamed soul. The bullfighter uses a spear to pierce the flesh of the bull to enrage and incite its feral attacks and in the end, kills it thereby demonstrating the superiority and nobleness of humanity. To Hua Chenyu, “Bullfight” is a sorrowful struggle with no winner. Whichever side that wins, bullfighter or bull, the other faces death. The song utilizes brutal satire to invoke introspection on life itself condensed into a Bullfight scene, and at the end gives us his answer: “Following our kind nature – the last pride and chance for the victory of mankind” in hopes of reawakening and resonating with the listeners’ inherent propensity for kindness. The MV is envisioned by Hua Chenyu and presented in a combination of CG and animation. At the shooting site of the MV, there is only Hua Chenyu acting on his lonesome, using his immersive imagination to achieve the actions and atmosphere required by the director. To convincingly act as a bullfighter, the director arranged for a Spanish coach to teach Hua Chenyu the professional moves of a bullfighter and guide his pose and movements in “Bullfight” scenes. Hua Chenyu was an eager and quick learner, and sweat and grinding hard work went behind every simple flick of the red cloth. The MV was produced by a Japanese production team, directed by Mitsunori Yokobori, and animated by Yoshiki Imazu. On February 14, 2020, Hua Chenyu enthusiastically sang “Bullfight (斗牛)”, the main song of his unreleased 4th album “NEW WORLD“, on EP2 of the Singing Talent Show Contest “Singer 2020“.

About the songMars Triology - Part One A work that calls for a better understanding of the feelings of depressive disorder patients.First released at Mars Concert 2019 on November 16, 2019. Officially released on December 4, 2019.It has broken the record for the number of digital single sales in China. On April 3, 2020, Hua Chenyu performed this song on EP9 of the Singing Talent Show Contest “Singer 2020“. On September 25, 2022, at the online concert “Mars Chapter“ celebrating the 9th anniversary of his debut, Hua Chenyu rearranged 11 songs in collaboration with a symphony orchestra and a choir. When we first encountered Hua’s music, we were deeply attracted to his carefree spirit expressed in songs like “I Don’t Care“ and “Aliens“. He is so cool that I feel a volcano could be chilled instantly by one look from him. As a child growing up without attentive parents, it’s understandable that he developed a coolness, a psychological mechanism to protect himself. He trained himself not to pay too much attention to social interactions, which was a mostly negative experience in his early childhood. He can isolate himself in a bubble and even enjoy being alone. An old Chinese saying is “When heaven is about to place a big responsibility on a person, it must first put him through ordeals and tribulations so as to break his will; subdue his spirit; exhaust his muscles; starve his flesh.” Out of Hua’s solitude and struggles, evident in songs like “Fake Monk“, he came out a strong-willed person with an extraordinary mind-frame and vision which have guided him through his early rise to fame without drowning his unique voice in an ocean of commercialization. He was able to hold on to his core beliefs and confidently handle earlier waves of slander in his career using this defense mechanism. In his own words, “No matter what the circumstance is, I can always make myself comfortable.” This confidence emanates from Hua’s understanding of Buddhist teachings: to gain enlightenment is to see through one’s own self-nature (the universal man not eclipsed by ego). Unenlightenment is the source of confusion and pain. By overcoming our ego, we can start to comprehend the causality (the cause and effect relationship of all things) in the world so that we will no longer be subjected to the whims of our irrational emotions and be condemned in eternal cycles of Samsara (incarnations). “Not pleased by external gains, not saddened by personal losses” has been the gentlemanly pursuit in the spirit of this philosophy. In other words, if you are enlightened, you will not be swayed by emotions and will stay worry-free. In earlier interviews such as “Who Am I Promotion” in 2015, he professed his belief perfectly: I am someone with zero worries, I have no confusion. I fully accept myself. I’ve come to understand that there’s nothing in this world that is the most important. When I was young, I was also someone keen on my dreams. But I don’t have any dreams now. I don’t dream to be a celebrity. I don’t have dreams in music. I mean… From what I understand, most people are pursuing happiness. But that’s not what I’m looking for. I only strive to have no worries. There’s nothing that you have to have and cannot let go of. “Letting go” is the mantra of Buddhism which means to let go of our ego filled with desires. Our dreams are often the reflection of our desires, so within the Buddhist belief system, it’s better not to dream. We should not only let go of our ego but also, to a large extent, our social being. This will also impose limitations on our mind due to the social norms that our social being gravitated towards, which is a hindrance to enlightenment. Given the non-attachment attitude of Buddhism, Hua developed a cold-eyed perspective on social relationships between people. He said, “For me, the relationship between people is just about using and being used by others. Since I don’t need to use others, why would I let others use me?” It is a blunt, and a bit of a detached, attitude. In summary, at that time, he had a very, very cool mentality. What has changed between then and now? The nonchalant rocker voice that sings “I don’t care what you think, taking me as a fool or a joke, I am my own expression” has changed to “I once thought of leaving… It’s because of those narratives, those stances and those inflicted pains” in “I’m Here AKA I Really Want to Love This World”. From not giving a damn about other people’s opinions to getting hurt by others’ narratives, we can’t help asking, has he lost his cool? The answer probably lies in Hua’s suppressed social being. Being detached from the crowd gives you freedom of mind and a carefree spirit, however, you also need to suppress your social being. That emotional and vulnerable social being needs love and support from family and friends as well as the approval of society, the very opposite of his cool persona. When life sails smoothly, his social being will not be too aggrieved and can be kept at bay to a degree. Hegel’s famous dialectical theory is that the antithesis of a thesis is bound to develop and emerge. So, as the antithesis of his detached being, his suppressed social being inevitably emerged in an unexpected way when it was wronged by his circumstances and ignored by his cool persona for too long. His earlier enlightenment offered no solution in this respect and it caught up with him in a big way–he was depressed. I can only imagine the shock he experienced when his former belief system was crushed so relentlessly. After all, he can’t stay worry-free and unbothered by his sense of being wronged. Years of mindfulness practice still couldn’t fend off his tumultuous emotions. Being honest, he exposed his vulnerabilities to us without reservation and made his struggles relatable to all of us. Who isn’t dealing with a suppressed identity of their own? We are dialectical in nature to begin with. When we profess one being, then our other beings will be suppressed. If we don’t recognize our hidden selves and take care of them, then some of them will force their way to our consciousness and wreak havoc. What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger. Let’s not forget that there is still the third part in Hegel’s theory: after the antithesis emerges, the thesis and antithesis will synthesize and a new thesis will emerge. So out of this depression, we can see that a new Hua Hua has already appeared. He has reconnected with his social being, he is close to his friends, his world is suddenly “filled with colors when smiles bloom”. He is taking care of his social being more than ever while still holding on to his former beliefs about universal perspective and universal love. He has deconstructed his old world and started a brand new world. No matter how gloomy his songs are, they always end on a brighter note and his struggles are never pointless. He always emerges stronger like he has a thousand times before when growing up. We can count on him for that. I am looking forward to witnessing his journey of self-exploration and discovery because it has always been an upward spiral. Counter darkness with gentleness, dispel depression with understandings, usher in beauties with a smile— these are what Hua Chenyu is looking forward to. As the song specially written for people suffering depression in the “Trilogy of Mars“, This song conveys Hua Chenyu’s sensibility and understanding of this world and his respect towards and his love of life. We hope everyone can meet the beauty of this world in love and goodness. Hua Chenyu specifically posted a commentary on the song on social media (Weibo): “I’m Here AKA I Really Want to Love This World” is the first song in the Mars trilogy I wrote this year. It’s about depression. People who are suffering depression are very afraid of being considered as “quite normal” and being ignored. When a day comes that he is willing to tell you that he may be sick, that proves he is taking you as a very important person to him. Therefore at that time, please don’t say as a first reaction things like “I feel you are fine, you look quite normal usually.” Please be aware that right after you say that, it may let him have anxiety towards the world and people. If you are a friend who is about to be sick or is already sick, I really hope this song can offer some warmth. If you are having a great life, I really hope that you can offer care to friends who are or about to be sick. 2.

About the songMars Triology - Part Three First duet song since his debut, and expressing Hua Chenyu’s bond with his fans, whose nickname is Martian (ET).Officially released on October 28, 2019。 To Love Is to UnderstandIn the promotion trailer for “Conversations With Children of Mars”, we see this quote: “The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved.” It seems that Hua did his soul-searching and decided that out of the many theories about the significance of life, to love and to be loved is what he identifies with.But how can one be convinced that he is loved? This is such an old topic that talking about it could be boring. But do we really understand it? In my own observation, we may know about this in theory but rarely can we practice it effectively.Obviously, being loved as a target of desire is flattering since it’s a response to, and a kind of approval of, a person based on his merits. Some people’s love is conditioned on whether their loved ones can maintain these merits and consequently it is egocentric. More often than not, the admiration of a person will evolve into a concern over their well-being, such that we would care about the pain and suffering of those we love. Over time, we grow attached to them. We worry about them, miss them, think about them, be happy for them, cheer for them, and encourage them when they stumble. Our love will gradually mature from being egocentric to altruistic, from being demanding to nurturing. Barrier…Having many, many fans, one would think that Hua Hua must have already attained his happiness by being the center of so many people’s attention and desire, and certainly a lot of fans love him as dearly as a family member. However, in the first half of the “Conversations With Children of Mars” MV, we see a metaphorical scene in which he is alone in a cave while his fans are separated from him and gazing on him from behind a transparent barrier. In the cave, the environment is dark and gloomy and Hua is confused and in pain. I can’t help wondering if this barrier has been imposed by himself, by Martians, or by both? Do you know about my pain?We do know that even among loving family members if there is a lack of mutual understanding, there is often a chasm between the giving end and the receiving end. If you are concerned about the well-being of those you love, but you don’t understand their vulnerability or their fear and you stay ignorant of their pain, then you may deeply offend their sense of dignity. They may feel that you have reduced their whole person to a few merits that please you and are of value to you. They may also feel that you project your own views of what is good and bad onto them and ignore their interests and needs. In all of these cases, no matter how strong your love is, it will drag down your loved ones like a burden rather than nurture them to be a better version of themselves.Of course, sometimes, the barrier is not entirely our fault. After all, we can’t even understand ourselves completely let alone another person. So it is necessary to communicate with each other. We see that Hua Hua has decided to open up to let us know about his happiness, anger, sadness, and joy so that we can have a chance to understand his inner struggles. It’s not just a conversation with Martians, but also a plea for understanding. An appeal for the beautiful, which hasn’t been accorded for some time but is “finally favored”.“I am no longer silent because you choose to understand me”– I think Hua’s line of lyrics is the essence of the whole song. To love is to understand. The effort in trying to understand another human being is the ultimate respect and love that we can offer. It’s about taking a person for what he is on the whole instead of distorting him to fit him into our narratives in order to please ourselves. Only through understanding, can we offer unconditional support to those we love. You have brought light into my worldBy calling out for understanding, Hua Hua bravely walks out of his cave and reconciles with that lonely and battered self treading water, who wants love yet can’t open himself up and who rejects people who come too close. “Martian Children” then reach out to him and reflect light into his world by holding up a mirror, and subsequently, his world is depicted in a warmer tone in the second half of the music video. Children’s view of the world is not tainted by ideasHere I have to bring up the metaphor in the song title. He calls it “Conversations With Martian Children”. Obviously, most Martians are not children but adults. However, only a pure and childlike mind can be observant and can take in a person in his totality. Therefore, by addressing Martians as children, he is calling out for the kind of understanding which is prejudice-free and only conceivable by a childlike mind. Reconcile with oneselfThis is indeed a first step towards the ideal of universal love. We have to reach out for mutual understanding if we want the chance to love and to be loved. Maybe most people still can’t understand each other, but there are always some who can. In sharing our own vulnerabilities, we allow other people to find resonance and strength in our struggles, and in the process, we start to look at each other as real human beings instead of being defined as a few ideas which we may or may not like. The MVHua Chenyu invited fans of all ages and identities to sit down and chat, and organized the chat content into lyrics. This communication process was also recorded as a MV.This MV is produced with a warm and healing style. It records the subtle changes of Hua Chenyu’s feelings inside. With the heartwarming accompany of Martians, he has become a stronger self from being seclusive and self-centered to gradually being open. This song is not only a gift to his fans but more so communication with people who love his music. They are experiencing the warmth from each other in this unique time and space. The healing power to both sides is the most touching.In the completed MV, Hua and his fans asked each other questions and wrote what they wanted to say to each other: Hua: If I ask you to use a word to describe me, what will occur to you?ET: Light and darkness are also in my heartEven superman could get tired. It doesn’t matterFeeling vulnerable occasionally is normalHua: I want to compose a song with everybody togetherIt’s a song about…us“Thank you” 2. VideosListen OnlineSpotify MV Mars Concert 2019 3.

About the songFirst released at Mars Concert 2019 on November 15, 2019, and is included in Hua Chenyu’s fourth album “NEW WORLD“.On March 13, 2020, Hua performed this song on EP6 of the Singing Talent Show Contest “Singer 2020“. Hua mentioned that “God Tree” and “Arrival (降临)“ represent Yin and Yang respectively. They symbolize the conflicting, yet balancing factors whose cyclic interactions determine the flourish and decay of all things in this world. While in appearance we can simply take “Arrival“ as the arrival of new lives and “God Tree” as the destruction of them, as Hua Hua himself explained, beneath there is more. We won’t blame the Singer 2020 audience who ranked these songs relatively low. One critic even said that Hua didn’t quite bring out the emotions in “Arrival“. There is no denying that “Arrival“ and “God Tree” fall outside the general sensibility in content although, in terms of their melodies, they are still very appealing and refreshing. So, what are the underlying emotions in “Arrival“ and “God Tree” that the audience may have missed? Needless to say, there is peace, sadness, bravery, fear, and determination. However, if I were to pick out one hidden, yet prominent emotion, then it’s the sense of helplessness: the despair of seeing masses of people walking toward their doom, yet there is nothing you can do to stop the tragedy, no matter how loudly you scream. Hua Hua has explained it well in an interview: – When I see myself as tiny, it broadens my perspective. Then, I can see many different things which I care a lot about. For example, nature. Many people don’t care about it as long as they are not the ones who are hurt. But actually, it’s not like that. When many things get destroyed in nature, it may not affect you right now, yet it may affect you in the future because there is a cascading effect. So “God Tree” is talking about this effect. I am quite alright with the low ranking of the song. Perhaps people want to listen to music that’s close to what’s in their hearts right now. “God Tree” and “Arrival“ are not competitive songs. Within the short time frame of one song, it’s quite impossible that the audience would be shocked. We can see that Hua Hua is very conscious that these two songs are far away from the heart of the audience right now. While he is always gentle in his manner in interviews, his performance of “God Tree” revealed that his attitude would contradict that. He is screaming and shouting in flashing lightning and deafening thunder. The sense of urgency and helplessness are tearing his world apart. This helplessness comes from the realization that the deafness of people is the result of entrapped minds that can’t see the invisible chains they unconsciously impose on themselves. To warn these minds about their predicament is tantamount to telling them that they are believing in transient and undependable relics of truth from the past. Most adults in this world are so sure of their beliefs and it’s hard to even nudge them a little bit outside of their comfort zone. So, under normal circumstances, such warnings would be swept away quickly. It takes courage to open up about it as Hua Hua did. I noticed that although he is fully aware that these songs may not strike a chord with the audience, at the end of his interview, he still defiantly asks the audience to “please carefully savor these two songs and many different things may appear”. Naturally, we want to ask: What could have caused this entrapment of the mind, and why is the song titled “God Tree”? For that we can refer to the metaphors from the mythological stories mentioned in “Arrival“ and even the Japanese anime series, Naruto, in which there is a God Tree that was created partially based on the story of Adam and Eve. The haphazardness of knowledge is the common theme of these creation mythologies. Knowledge has a high status in our minds because without it we would have been living in the constant flux of contingent events of the phenomenal world. We would have never been able to grasp the laws of this world and make any progress. However, no matter how valid knowledge was at the time of its creation, knowledge is categorically the knowledge of the past, the bygone world of yesterdays. While some ideas of knowledge are science-based discoveries of the universal laws which are still applicable to the foreseeable future, a lot of others, especially in the form of ideologies, are unscrupulously accepted from habits and conventions which are out of sync with the reality of the here and now. Our attachment to our knowledge traps us in the past and sets limitations to our perceptions. The God Tree that Hua sings about is the knowledge tree in Paradise which seems to have nourished the world for a long time, but in reality, it’s sucking away its vitality. Such is the force of death: our ineptness to see what we are doing to the environment, our lag in cognition to its dangers, is all due to our attachment to our “old ways”, which is bringing, and will bring, more disasters. In contrast, the force of life is the constant renewal of knowledge. In “Arrival“, we see that the start of this renewal process is alluded to by the returning of the apple (the fruit from the tree of knowledge) to Paradise, the place where knowledge was first born and where the judgment of good or bad does not exist. In addition, the end of this renewal process is alluded to in the lyrics by the descent from Paradise with “new sprouts”. If we make a connection between the knowledge tree and the new sprout, then it’s apparent that this “new sprout” is a metaphor for renewed knowledge. I might add that knowledge from Paradise has more importance than that from our common understanding, because it is not derived from a place with presumed judgments, thus it’s prejudice-free. But to return to Paradise is difficult given that we have been living in a world full of judgments for so long. That gulf between Paradise and our world is almost insurmountable. How could we suspend judgments even briefly? We live in a judgmental world. To take action, we have to make quick decisions based on our knowledge. Can we halt our actions even briefly so that we don’t have to judge for a while? The renewal of knowledge requires the action-free tranquility expressed in “Arrival“ in its melody. But where on earth can we find that tranquility, the true tranquility which is not tainted by ideas from the past at all? Such tranquility is not possible unless we actively and purposefully seek it with the correct method. This helplessness is subtly expressed in “Arrival“ when he sings that “secrets are revealed too much, too much, and Narcissus can scarcely hold back his tears”. Why is the revelation of secrets sad? It’s because the secret matters a lot and yet if you tell people about it, the hope of being understood is slim. It is all the more moving considering how conscious Hua and his lyricist are aware of this reality. The dialectics between life and death, or the renewal of knowledge and the attachment to old knowledge, are the two coexisting, breathing forces that move our fates along their interplays. In the words of Hua Hua’s most recent interview: “‘Arrival‘ and ‘God Tree’ can be viewed as the rotational forces in Tai-Chi (the core symbol of Taoism).” Being dialectical means that none of the opposing forces will be judged as bad. Both are indispensable components of a vibrant system. Without knowledge, we won’t have any certainty of the laws behind the phenomenal world and we will be unable to make any progress. However, without casting old knowledge away, we cannot adapt to the constantly changing environment. The old idea from the east is that when one of the balancing factors, Yin or Yang, overwhelms the other, then evil arises. It requires our consciousness to keep these opposing factors in check. If we stay ignorant of them, we can never hope to escape from their ruthless hands. Therefore, as expressed in “God Tree”, no matter how slim the chance is, we will “never give up, never give up”. 2.

About the songFirst released at Mars Concert 2018 on September 8, 2018, and is included in Hua Chenyu’s fourth album “NEW WORLD“.On March 20, 2020, Hua performed this song on EP7 of the Singing Talent Show Contest “Singer 2020“. “God Tree“ and “Arrival” respectively symbolize destruction and rebirth. They are mirrors and oppose each other. The two songs aim to explore the possibility of harmonious coexistence between man and nature and regain the original respect and awe of life. “Arrival” combines the five-tone melody mode with the lyrics of Western imagery to show the new national style of music. The repeated singing of “La vi ah vi ah vi” creates a peaceful atmosphere of renewal of all things and new shoots descending. It is a pious way of rebirth and blessings and conveys a heart of forgiveness towards everything. 2. VideosListen OnlineSpotify Mars Concert 2019 “Singer 2020” EP7 3.

About the songOfficially released on April 8, 2020, as the title song of Hua Chenyu’s 4th album “NEW WORLD“. This song was an original song created based on “Shouts”, a cover song Hua Chenyu performed at the finals of “Singer 2018“. And on March 27, 2020, Hua enthusiastically sang this new song on EP8 of “Singer 2020“. Composed on the eve of Hua Chenyu’s sixth anniversary of his debut, “New World” is the title song of Hua Chenyu’s 4th album and comprises of the summarization of his first five years in the music industry, signifying his entering into a higher stage. This magnificent composition is the distillation of Hua Chenyu’s unique understanding of music and the world captured through his eyes. The lyrics convey a sense of transcending beyond the struggles and victories in life; of standing alone at the summit after the arduous climb. The melody presents the complex relationship between sensibility and rationality, the unyielding resolve after the strike of an epiphany, and the uninhibition that defies all and yet encompasses all. It is worth mentioning that in “New World” we hear Hua Chenyu’s first incorporation of the imitation of Xun by the human voice. Xun (埙) is one of the oldest wind instruments in China, it makes a pure, reverberating sound that can be soft or rich. Hua Chenyu used his vocals to mimic Xun to allude to breaking free of a confining cage, defiant and unafraid to soar to heights unexplored. The vocalize building layer upon layer shines through unseeing fog to discover a path, the storm of quick rapping hammers on the heart, and his singing voice catches hold of you and brings you rising to meld into the galaxy. Through his music, Hua Chenyu blazes the way to a wild and open-world beyond your imagination, a conception with its every fiber formed from his artistic insights to the world and the self. 2.

The idea behind Size 40 was that a person really doesn’t need to take up too much space in the world. After all, you only have two feet, so you only need so much space to stand in. In true Hua Hua fashion, his sentiment is to just “go with the flow”; otherwise, there’s no need to make a big fuss. As long as you’re standing, your existence is valuable. Later, after receiving the lyrics for the song “Quasimodo’s Gift”, he changed his mind. He really liked the lyrics to the song, as they were true to the melody. This was the feeling he wanted for the album, so he decided to use the name of the song as the name of the album. He hoped everyone would learn to accept the negative things in life, even the ugliness we may encounter. Since everything has two sides, beauty may be hidden within those negative things. It’s just a matter of learning to see both the good and the bad.Among the ten songs on the album, three were Hua’s original compositions; “Why Nobody Fights”, “Let You Go”, and “Quasimodo’s Gift”. In addition to composing for this album, Hua also participated in the entire production of the album as well as selected the other seven songs from nearly 20,000 demos. All the songs chosen for this album are connected by the themes of thunder, rain, smoke, dew, light and dreams. The album was produced by Bernard Zheng and production lasted for nine months. Zheng arranged nine of the songs in rock and roll style and he also did the piano and guitar arrangements for the album. The copywriting for Hua Chenyu’s first album was prepared by Wu Mengzhi, now a director for Hunan TV. 卡西莫多的礼物 Quasimodo’s Gift Lyricist Composer 1 Why Nobody FightsMV Why Nobody Fights Hua Chenyu Hua Chenyu 2 微光 Glimmer Zhou Jieying Qian Lei 3 Let You Go Let You Go Xia Yuan Hua Chenyu 4 烟火里的尘埃MV Ashes from Fireworks Albert Leung Xi Lou 5 拆弹专家 Bomb Squad Zhao Zhisheng Dúné 6 环游 Traveling Nagatomo Chie MeiLiu Yuan Dúné 7 我们都是孤独的 We are all Lonely Dai Yuedong The Blue Van 8 不朽MV Immortal Guo Deziyi Dúné 9 卡西莫多的礼物Short Movie Quasimodo’s Gift Bei Zi Hua Chenyu 10 枕边故事 Bedside Story Dai Yuedong Ronald Tsui 2.

Lyrics TranslationLyricist: nekoyCompose: Hua ChenyuArrange: Bernard Zheng, Hua Chenyu 风之海 Sea of Wind 摘一片云朵 Catch a wisp of cloud 踏在脚下看日落 and ascend it to watch the sunset 你在云的那头 Beyond the clouds’ edge, 掀起 一阵阵幻想 推着我走 you evoke waves of dreamsthat propel me forward. 想让你为我停留 Might you pause for me? 我迟钝伸出双手 With tentative hands, I reach out, 捕捉你的身影 Trying to catch traces of you, 瞬间 却弄丢你来时的线索 Yet swiftly, I lost the clues of your arrival. 唤醒我 Awaken me 指引我 Guide me 告诉我 Tell me 在哪里等待你会来认领我 Where can I wait for you to sweep me away? 你记得我最纯净的轮廓 You remember my purest silhouette, 握住小小风车和放肆的梦 Holding a small windmill and untamed dreams. 你小心保管我不思议的念头 You carefully guard my unconscious musing, 秘密从不会对谁泄露 Never reveal the secret to anyone. 平凡中寻得我拥抱你的温柔 Amidst the ordinary,I found the gentleness to embrace you, 而你却 有保留 地遇见我 Yet you approached me with a guarded heart, 不屑被谁所有 Loathing to be tethered by anyone, 你该有多自由 how boundless is your freedom. 我慌张奔走 I roam around in angst, 多像你来去无踪 So much like you,arriving and departing without a trace. 世界如此宽广 The world is so vast, 我们 终究要登上哪座山峰 To which pinnacle are we destined to ascend? 晴雨日升和月落 Through rain and glow, dawn and dusk, 你经过必有回声 Your passage will leave echoes. 起风时候 When the winds blow, 记得 再次 呼喊我奔跑吧跟随风 Remember to call upon me once moreto chase their gusts. 唤醒我 Awaken me 指引我 Guide me 告诉我 Tell me 在哪里走散你都会找到我 Wherever I get lost, you will find me. 你记得我最纯净的轮廓 You remember my purest silhouette, 握住小小风车和放肆的梦 Holding a small windmill and untamed dreams. 你小心保管我不思议的念头 You carefully guard my unconscious musing, 秘密从不会对谁泄露 Never reveal the secret to anyone. 平凡中寻得我拥抱你的温柔 Amidst the ordinary,I found the gentleness to embrace you, 躲在你 怀抱 Cradled in your embrace, 只顾向前走 I march onward without hesitation, 却探不到尽头 Yet with no end apparent; 你该有多 辽阔 such is your boundless infinity. 风吹醒 沉睡那首歌 Wind awakened the slumbering song, 追寻歌声 Chasing after the melody, 便找到风的海 we found the sea of wind, 小小孩是否能听见 它在笑呀 Can you hear the wind’s laughter,my little child? 欢唱吧 Sing joyfully, 呼唤他 Call out to him, 回来啊 Come back! 你经过我每个灿烂时刻 In every splendid moment you drift past, 我才真正学会如你般自由 I come to truly grasphow to embrace freedom as you do. 而你也曾温柔躲进她的眼眸 Once you also tenderly nestled within her gaze, 孤独被染上童话底色 And imbued solitude in fairytale hues. 任世界多宽广 Despite the world’s vast expanse, 停泊在这港口 anchor here in this harbor, 握住一瞬间 称它为永久 Seize the moment, and call it eternity. 再黯淡的星河 都趁着风闪烁 Even the faintest stars will twinkle with the wind.","link":"/kazenoumi/"},{"title":"2023 Event information","text":"Event information other than personal concerts.

OriginWhen first debuted, Hua Chenyu was often referred to as the “boy from Mars (火星弟弟)” by the media, due to his slightly strange personality.Hua simply made “MARS” his image symbol, and promised his fans that “someday we will return to Mars together.” To fulfill this promise, Hua named his personal concert “MARS CONCERT (火星演唱会).” By the way, His fans also received the nickname “ET (Martian，火星人)“. 2. A Regular Part of MARS CONCERT Greet fans with “Welcome home (欢迎回家)” as the first greeting. When performing the song “The World is a Zoo (世界是个动物园)“, Hua always sings “oiaioiaioiaiaio” with a random melody and makes his fans repeat it. The melody gradually becomes more complex, and it always ends on a high note that fans can’t sing, thus becoming a reason for Hua to laugh at his fans. Before the concert ends, be sure to thank each staff and partner, such as band members, company, security team, fire brigade, etc. Every time Hua pronounces a name, ETs shout “Thank you”. From 2014 to 2017, always sing Leslie Cheung’s famous song I Am What I Am (我) as the last encore. Since this is a very special song for Hua and he only has the strength to sing it once a year, he wanted to use that only opportunity for MARS CONCERT. In 2018, after singing I Am What I Am (我), Hua went on to sing an unreleased new song “New World (新世界)” and declared to fans, “From now on, I will take you to a new world.” Through this action, Hua embarked on a new journey in his life. Starting in 2021, MARS CONCERT has been upgraded to an outdoor rock festival. Hua put his rock songs in the more exciting Evening Show, and put his early songs and some pop songs in the more relaxed Matinee. Also, rearranging songs into unplugged version for Matinee and singing along with guest Zuo Li has become a regular occurrence. We don’t know since when, fans started asking Hua for kisses during impromptu interactions, and Hua always satisfied fans with a “kiss song” after a “brewing”. 3.

New song “Sea of Wind (风之海)“ released for the first time. This is Hua Chenyu’s first attempt at writing a refreshing song, and it is said to be the overall tone for his next album. A four-day festival was held at a park near the venue, and fans bought goods and exchanged small gifts with each other at the park during the day, and then entered the venue directly at night. September 29th was the Mid-Autumn Festival, a traditional Chinese holiday. Just like during the Dragon Boat Festival, Hua Chenyu prepared mooncake gift sets limited to the Mid-Autumn Festival and sold them exclusively at festival stalls.

Because the stadium is located in a university town and has a relatively low ceiling, large monitors set up on four sides of the top of the stage can be seen in many surrounding open spaces and dormitories.

Lyrics TranslationLyricist: Shi HeCompose: Hua ChenyuArrange: Bernard Zheng 寻 Seek 枕边没有风浪 If there are no winds nor waves by our pillow 怎么我们会跌荡摇晃 How is it that we would tumble and sway? 伸手不见月光 Without the darkness of moonless nights 怎么繁星能闪耀光芒 How can stars shine so bright? 脚印会旧而梦还在走 Footsteps may fade, yet dreams will continue 太阳尚远但一定会有 The sun is still far away, yet it will be there forever 等到天亮我们都寻找到最漂亮愿望 When dawn arrives,we will find the most beautiful wishes 好景多长 How long will good times last? 路上还有暗香 Along the road, there is still a faint fragrance 天色渐淡 Under the dimming sky, 迎面还有风凉 I can still feel a cooling breeze 世界多广 How vast is the world? 转身还有故乡 Behind us, there is still home 找一个方向 Seek a path Let us fly Let us fly 沿途风景如歌变幻 再辗转 Undulating like a songThe scenery on the road shifts and turns 人山人海的对白换一句等待 Dialogues among millionsAre replaced with one word: “Wait!” 看不懂黑白却听得到钟摆 I cannot see through black and whiteBut I can hear pendulum swinging 去新世界冒险和内心作伴 作伴 Venturing into a new worldI am my own heart’s companion 风吹刹那不知你在向哪片日落 张望 When the wind blows pastWhich way are you looking for in the sunset? 很多话想说转过身只看见荒漠 空旷 I have so many words to sayYet turning around, I only see a barren desert 一个人难免崇拜流浪 Alone,it is hard not to be consumed by wanderlust 却变成和自己的迷藏 Somehow, it had turned into a riddle of the self 最好的旅途是让我们记住爱的模样 The best journeys instill within us the shape of love 好景多长 How long will good times last? 路上还有暗香 Along the road, there is still a faint fragrance 天色渐淡 Under the dimming sky, 迎面还有风凉 I can still feel a cooling breeze 世界多广 How vast is the world? 转身还有故乡 Behind us, there is still home 只要你在旁 As long as you are by my side Let us fly Let us fly 我看着你在花的梦中坐下 In my dreams of flowers,I see you sitting down 你牵着我在山的宽阔中睡下 Holding my hands,you led me to sleep in the vastness of the mountain 毕竟我们只有一生这么长 After all, a lifetime is only so long 要用力给人间留下些印象 We should try to leave our marks in the world Let us fly Let us fly 沿路旅途如歌变幻在游览 Like a song, the trip along the road is ever changing We are exploring 还给大地昨天的喜怒和烦忧 Return yesterday’s joys and sorrows to earth 下个春天回来我就会回家 I’ll be home when the next spring arrives 爱如少年把故事说完长大 To love like a youthLet’s finish our story and grow up","link":"/04-09-xun/"},{"title":"Qi Tian AKA Wu Kong (齐天)","text":"1.

About the songOfficially released on September 19, 2017. The song continues the popular rap with progressive reinforced rap and some Rock, criticizing the false and contradictory lifestyle of the real society in the name of “boring people”(“I’m Boring”). Hua Chenyu’s rap style. This is the 27-year-old Hua Chenyu wrote to his own advanced life Flow! When the boring man sings boring music, he returns to realism and criticizes without any concern. Abandoning the vicious attitude of a hothead, the naked clamoring chanting, the change of multiple timbre and span of the tone, let the original gray emotions of life be vented. “With the growth of age, under the pressure of life, many people see through the powerless and self-willed reality, survival, and hypocrisy of the fittest and greet, there will be a feeling of being unable to keep up. I wrote this song to see what would happen if there is no one around. “This is 27-year-old Hua Chenyu who wrote about his own advanced life Flow. “I’m Boring” vents the gray emotions of life to the fullest. “How many people are able to understand the emptiness in their hearts, they just live in the moment till they die.” “Surely a fool is happy to consume his enthusiasm, and you can earn probation of splattering if you play a stupid play. Afraid of being caught but haven’t yet. It is the stimulus you always seek.” The lyrics lively dissect the truth you already know but avoid to mention, and criticize the absurd and hypocritical “adult world” from the perspective of a bystander. “I’m Boring” was named by Hua Chenyu personally. The change of multiple timbre and range of spans inherited his unique popular hard-core rap style. The lyrics exhaled the original gray emotions of life. Zheng Nan’s way of merging the style brings unlimited development opportunities for Hua Chenyu’s rap and the cooperation between the two created a fresh and strong sense for the audience. 2.

Achievements In 2023, Hua Chenyu held a live tour around China in the style of a rock festival. The theme of this tour is to take fans to the great rivers and mountains of the motherland, and Hua even promised an all-night sunrise concert. In the first half of the year, there were a total of 11 days of performances in four cities: Hangzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan, and Changsha, and each day was still divided into Matinee and Evening Show, and the ticket price had not changed. The stage was also newly constructed and was even bigger than 2021. The stage for this tour was designed by the production team for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, and was expected to be the most expensive personal concert stage in China. The main stage was a 28m high “science fiction city” made up of giant art installations. By using mirrored single-transparent materials over a large area, the stage was completely integrated with the natural environment, and different magical effects appeared from different viewpoints and at different times. Sometimes it felt like a “mirage of the sea” and the stage has “disappeared”. At night, 10 sets of huge mobile devices could move in various directions using the cross tracks on the stage, dividing the stage into multiple spaces. Images and lighting were randomly refracted in different spaces made up of mirror surfaces, and different effects could be seen from different positions, creating an ever-changing effect. The “Planet” stage was like a “interstellar device” of the “Martian civilization”, and the extension platform connected to the main stage penetrated the audience seats as a “Martian civilization” corridor. These spatial structures were surrounded by giant ring devices that resemble planetary orbits. According to the intention of each song, the circular orbit could create laser shows, artificial snowfall and other romantic miracles. » Stage Design Photo Gallery « » Poster and Highlight Photo Gallery « 2. Anecdote “Mars Food Street” in each city on the tour selected local specialties for sale. Furthermore, since the Changsha concerts happened to be held on China’s traditional Dragon Boat Festival, two types of gift sets containing Zongzi or green bean cake were on sale for a limited time. Promotional posters for each city used the same photo, but the background featured landmark buildings of that city. A different sentence was printed each day on the long ribbon paper that was sprayed at the end of the performance: Translation Original Hangzhou Day1 Spring is warm and flowers are in bloom, welcome home! 春暖花开，欢迎回家！ Day2 The flowers are blooming,let’s go for an outing together! 花开了，一起去郊游吧！ Day3 Believe in Hope, Growing Toward the Sun! 相信希望，向阳而生！ Chengdu Day1 Landed Mars, welcome home! 火星降临，欢迎回家！ Day2 Fly to search for the red meteor! 飞吧 去寻觅 红色的流星！ Day3 After the dispersal,will you forget me! 散场后，会不会忘了我！ Wuhan Day1 Mars, We are Home! 火星，我们，回家啦！ Day2 Mars, let love grow, let us face the sun! 火星 让爱生长 让我们向阳！ Changsha Day1 ［Dreams］where it all begins ~♥ ［梦］开始的地方~♥ Day2 Let’s together find the most beautiful wishes 我们一起寻找到最漂亮的愿望 Day3 Mars, ten years,See you at the Bird’s Nest! 火星，十年，鸟巢见！ Hangzhou Concert A few days before Mars Concert 2021, Covid-19 suddenly broke out in Zhejiang, and fans there were either prohibited from entering the park or had to watch in designated quarantine areas. Therefore, Hua Chenyu arranged the first concert of this year’s tour in Hangzhou. It rained for 10 consecutive days in Hangzhou before the concert, but it happened to clear up during the three days of the concerts. The lawn, which cost tens of millions of yuan to install, turned into a quagmire due to the rain, but temporary vinyl boards were erected and shoe covers were properly distributed, and the quagmire could not stop the enthusiasm of over 100,000 fans. The vast open space once used to set up the concert stage was named “Mars Lawn” by fans and has been registered on Baidu Maps, China’s most commonly used map website. Even though six months have passed, fans still came to the lawn from time to time to look for “Mars ruins”, such as small watermelons grown from watermelon seeds left in the ground by the Mars Food Street. Fans also hid various small souvenirs on the lawn so that fans who visit later can enjoy a “treasure hunt.” » Hangzhou Concert Photo Gallery « Chengdu Concert Chengdu Open Air Music Park is the top open-air music performance venue and music-themed urban park in China. Encompassing an area of approximately 317,000 square meters, the park has the capacity to host open air concerts accommodating up to 40,000 spectators or semi-indoor concerts for 10,000 attendees. The Evening Show was scheduled to start at 19:30, but since Chengdu is located in the midwestern part of China and it gets dark late, Hua Chenyu delayed it by more than 30 minutes to get the best visual effect of the opening. » Chengdu Concert Photo Gallery « Wuhan Concert When rehearsing, there were heavy rains several times a day, and the weather forecast was full of rain, so the organizers and fans only took precautions against the rain. However, on the day of the concert, high temperatures of over 35 degrees hit, and many spectators became unwell. Hua Chenyu took urgent measures to prevent heatstroke, making the water sold free of charge, purchasing a lot of non-edible ice, crushing it and throwing it into various parts of the audience area, and releasing a large amount of dry ice. Hua Chenyu also announced that the start time of Matinee the next day would be postponed from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, but the repertoire would be not reduced. In other words, the only thing that would be reduced was Hua’s own rest time. That night, Hua urgently purchased multiple outdoor air-conditioning fans from other provinces, and installed them in the most densely populated infield area. During the evening show on the first day, in the park where the venue was located, only the concert area did not rain. The previous concerts in Hangzhou and Chengdu also went against the weather forecast, and the weather suddenly cleared up only during the performances. At the evening show the next day, Hua Chenyu admitted that Mars does indeed have mysterious powers. Hua then directly responded to the anti-fans’ slander, saying that perhaps he is loved by the sun because he wrote the song “Growing Toward the Sun (向阳而生)“ and that even the weather forecast can’t beat him. The next day at Matinee, Hua said “Welcome to China” while singing “My Skateboard Shoes 2016 (我的滑板鞋2016)“, which was the first time he publicly expressed his welcome to foreign fans. » Wuhan Concert Photo Gallery « Changsha Concert In the days leading up to the performance, it rained heavily several times almost every day. Furthermore, Hua Chenyu prayed for rain to cool off in his rehearsal vlog. As a result, all three days of performances were held in the rain. At Matinee, Hua performed under a transparent umbrella. The show started 30 minutes early because according to Changsha city regulations, performances must end at 9:30. As a result, the sky was still very bright during the first hour, so the visual effects of the stage and lasers were significantly reduced. The video that was played during the encore (looking back on the decade since debut and preview of the next Bird’s Nest concert) was a surprise prepared by the staff without telling Hua Chenyu. The video was narrated by He Jiong, the famous Chinese host, and the host of Hua’s debut show “Superboy 2013“ ten years ago. About an hour after the end of the final performance, Hua Chenyu suddenly started a live broadcast to reduce the “aftereffects of a concert” and chatted with fans while eating skewers. Zuo Li also joined in afterwards. They talked about stage sets, favorite costumes, and the birth of the most memorable moments in the concert. » Changsha Concert Photo Gallery « 3.

About the show“The Next” (also known as “Sound of War”) is a singing competition/show where anyone can challenge mature singers, and fight for dreams to reach the top. From the start of each episode, 7 ordinary people from all walks of life will choose a singer to challenge, and each singer warrior (singers) would choose to accept a single challenger. The song the challenger chose for the singer warrior will then be revealed, and the singer warrior must compete with their challenger by singing the chosen song. The singer warriors have 24 hours to rearrange to chosen songs, and after 24 hours, they will face their challengers on the stage with 400 audiences who would cast their votes to decide the winner. On average, the rearrangement of a song goes along the lines of choosing a style, composing a demo, rearranging, settling the music sheets, rehearsals, etc. This process usually takes 1 week, but in “The Next”, the time is shortened to only 24 hours, with 4 singer warriors sharing one music band. In the second half of the competition, each of the surviving challengers form a combination with a singer, and compete against other teams by performing together.In addition to Hua, singers in the Season 2 also includes Karen Mok, Fei Yu-ching, Yang Kun and Jason Zhang. Karen Mok, whom Hua met in Season 1, asked Hua to compose for her new album. Coincidentally, a few years ago, Hua wrote down a DEMO suitable for Karen to sing and named it “Karen Mok”, so he gave the DEMO directly to Karen. The DEMO later became “Half a Lifelong Romance (半生缘)“, which is included in Karen’s new album.This was Hua’s first compose work for Others. 2.

Detailed information about each episode EP1: Maiden Of Alisan (阿里山的姑娘)Original Singer: QingshanOctober 15, 2017 In the first episode of Season 2, Hua Chenyu sang the Taiwanese folk song “Maiden Of Alisan” by adapting it to his own style. EP2: HEAVEN (天堂)Original Singer: TenggerOctober 29, 2017 Hua Chenyu adapted a Mongolian folk song that praised one’s hometown into a New Age style. EP3: The Phantom Lover (夜半歌声)Original Singer: Leslie CheungNovember 5, 2017 The recording of the show was on the second day of the “Mars Concert 2017“. Hua Chenyu suffered from severe tinnitus due to overwork, and even worried that “I might never be able to make music again in the future.”But he gave the song 100 percent respect. He did not make drastic changes, conveying all the emotions to the audience through just a piano and his voice. EP4: Endless Embrace (深情相拥)with Zhao YouqiaoOriginal Singer: Leslie Cheung ft Winnie HsinNovember 11, 2017 EP5: I’m Ugly, But I’m Very Gentle (我很丑可是我很温柔)Original Singer: Chief ChaoNovember 18, 2017 Hua Chenyu thinks of herself, “Although I’m not handsome, I’m not ugly either.” So in order to prevent the audience from focusing on his appearance, he chose to wear a black mask. EP6: Code Name Contra (代号魂斗罗)Derived from the theme melody of the game “Contra”November 25, 2017 Since there aren’t any instruments or vocals in the game’s MIDI soundtrack, it’s fair to say Hua Chenyu created an entirely new song in 24 hours rather than just rearranging it. EP7 No PerformanceDecember 2, 2017 Draw a bye. Rest for one episode EP8: Dad, I’m Home (爸，我回来了)Original Singer: Jay ChouDecember 9, 2017 The theme of this song is domestic violence, and Hua Chenyu perfectly played the image of a boy who suffered domestic violence in the form of the narration.After the show aired, many viewers who didn’t know the truth assumed that this was Hua’s real experience. EP9: Drunk As Lonely Hero (一人饮酒醉)December 16, 2017 “Drunk As Lonely Hero” is a representative work of the “喊麦 (shouting mic)” music category popular among Chinese folk. To put it simply, it is similar to rap freestyle.Hua created a beautiful song based on Chinese classical music by adding melodies to rap. EP10-11 No PerformanceDecember 23, 2017 Draw a bye.

About the songDerived from the openning song of the Chinese TV drama “Journey to the West”, “Yun Gong Xun Yin (Vocal-less)”.First released at singing competition “The Next S1“ EP7 in 2017. “The Next” (also known as “Sound of War”) is a singing competition/show where anyone can challenge mature singers.

The singer warriors have 24 hours to rearrange to chosen songs, and after 24 hours, they will face their challengers on the stage with 400 audiences who would cast their votes to decide the winner. “Yun Gong Xun Yin” is the theme melody of the popular TV drama “Journey to the West” that aired in 1986. Because every Chinese is very familiar with this melody, it is very difficult to adapt it. As a result, Hua Chenyu’s performance was a great success, and the song also became Hua’s signature work. Originally, due to copyright, it could not be performed outside of the show, but around 2018, Hua Chenyu removed the melody of “Yun Gong Xun Yin” from the prelude and also changed the middle chorus to his own original melody.The original melody is the chorus melody he composed for “Nunchucks (双截棍)“, which he covered on the Singing Talent Show Contest “Singer 2018“. 2.

The level of the band hired for the show was too low. Hua Chenyu wanted to change the band but failed. Therefore, He invited Khalil Fong to be the guitarist, and together they played the unplugged version of “Aliens (异类)“ and won the show.

What is HCY148?“HCY” = Hua Chenyu“148” means Hua Chenyu has 148 sides of personalities and music genres. 2. Member Introduction Demon King大魔王 (da4 mo2 wang2) 魔 (mo2) = demon王 (wang2) = king 魔（demon）in Chinese culture is a concept coming from Buddhism. It refers to various factors that hinder the attainment of enlightenment. There are four kinds of demons: the demon of five sensory organs, the demon of worries, the demon of emotions leading to early death and the demon of trying too hard to attain enlightenment.In the novel “Journey to The West”, the Big Demon King is Wu Kong, who is rebellious to the idea of being abstain from all emotions, desires, and sensory distractions. Consequently, he is the Big Demon King. Hua Hua is literally taking a stance by calling himself the “Big Demon King”. He is affirming these human characteristics as the basic fabric in our being just like Wu Kong.In HCY148, Demon King also refers to the state Hua Hua is in when he’s on stage. The gaze that changes once the music starts to play. The fierce stage presence that he exudes. The full immersion in his own world when performing a song.The Demon King was first unleashed during Super Boy 2013 Concert Tour in Hangzhou in the year 2014 when Hua Hua took off his signature black-rimmed glasses and caught everyone off guard with this whole new side of his.Since then, Demon King has been spotted from time to time be it during Mars Concert, music festival, commercial performance, etc. and continues to be one of the most frequently sighted HCY148. Mr. Vocalist主唱大人 Like the Demon King, Mr. Vocalist is a character full of superstar aura, but he puts more emphasis on musical attributes.Mr. Vocalist is what a rock star should be. When he stands on stage, he is invincible. By the way, the Demon King and the Mr. Vocalist are Hua Chenyu’s favorite members. Sweet Cutie (cutie pie)小可爱 A moe character that’s cuter than a three-year-old child. Dorky Orange呆橘 (dai1 ju2) This is Hua’s classic look when he first started his journey towards stardom under the public’s eyes.This look consists of a pair of black-rimmed glasses, bangs that covers his eyebrows, and a frequent wide grin.The word 橘(orange) comes from the incident where he ate quite a number of mandarin oranges while waiting for his turn during the first audition for “Super Boy 2013“. Hua ended up having stomach discomfort and was at the restroom when his turn came. Thus the famous scene where his contestant number “08042” was called repeatedly everywhere while looking for him.As for the word 呆(dorky) refers to the dorky and adorable side of Hua at that time. He used to avoid the camera as much as he could and often answered slowly in single word or short phrases during interviews. Even up until today, this adorkable Hua continues to capture many hearts with his dorky answers and adorable grin. Camera Hua一目大师 (yi1 mu4 da4 shi1) When Hua Chenyu takes a photo with one eye closed, he is known as the Camera Hua (一目大师), which means “single eye”Camera Hua’s birthday is July 20, 2017. On this day, Hua published several photos taken on the variety show “Flowers on Trip (旅途的花样)“ on Sina Weibo under the name “Camera Hua”From then on, Hua used the name “Camera Hua” every time he posted photography (except selfies) Shell-head Brother壳哥 (ke2 ge1) 壳 (ke2) means shell or case; 哥 (ge1) means elder brother.This name was given as it looked like an egg shell.The story of how Shell-head Brother came into being is quite funny. In “Flowers on Trip (旅途的花样)“ Episode 6, Hua Hua initially went to Er-jie’s room in search of facial mask. When he saw Lin Chi-ling trimming her hair, Hua became interested and mentioned that his bangs was getting too long.From there, things spiralled real fast and before he knew it, Hua was sitting obediently with a clean pot on his head while Lin Chi-ling and Er-jie were cutting his hair. The outcome? Shell-head Brother made his first appearance and HCY148 officially welcomed a new member into the fold.When Hua first saw his new haircut, he admitted that he did not expect it to be so short. However, this new hairstyle turned out to be much well-loved when he appeared in “The Coming One S1“ as it further accentuated his suave side.However, in 2018 just when Martians were getting used to seeing Fluffy Hua, Hua Hua suddenly announced in Weibo that he had cut his hair short again.And so, Shell-head Brother returned as Shell-head Brother 2.0 and took the Bird’s Nest (Beijing National Stadium) by storm with his Mars Concert for two consecutive days.After that, Shell-head Brother could also be seen in several other occasions such as “The Coming One S2“ and Zhuhai Shark Music Festival Flowers on Trip EP6, Hua's CUT Barcode Hua条形码 (tiao2 xing2 ma3) 条形码 means barcode.This hairstyle comes with wispy bangs that covers both eyes entirely, creating a curtain-like effect, which in turn looks like the parallel lines of a barcode.It was said that one day when Hua was preparing for an award ceremony, he told his stylist that he did not want his eyes to be seen by others on that day. So his stylist came up with this hairstyle to fulfil his request and so Barcode Hua was officially added into HCY148Barcode Hua can only be found in a few events in the year 2014 such as IQIYI Scream Night, Young Choice 2014, and Tomorrow’s Party.Barcode Hua’s well-known speech was during the award presentation of IQIYI Scream Night 2015: “Lastly, what I’d like to say to my fans is I know that you don’t care how many awards I’ve received, or how popular I am in the (entertainment) industry. So I’d like to say to you, today my health is great and my mood is great too. So please, take good care of yourselves.” Whiskers Hua须须 (xu1 xu1) 须 means whiskers and this name is derived from the whisker-like feelers of catfish.The “whisker-like” side bangs of Whisker Hua creates an innocent feel.Along with Curly Hua, Whiskers Hua is grouped as fairy-like HCYs as his ethereal beauty awed those who saw him.Whiskers Hua is well-known for his gentleness and childlike charms.However, behold! Though childlike and gentle as he looks, Whiskers Hua has proven that he can be fierce looking too once the music starts to play.Traces of Whiskers Hua can be found in quite a number of events and programmes in the year 2017 such as “Sing with Me“ Season 2, first few episodes of “Flowers on Trip (旅途的花样)“ Season 1, Mercedes Benz AMG 50th Anniversary, Sakura Muse Night and In - Music Concert.The most memorable music festivals of Whiskers Hua are B.I.G Carnival and Strawberry Music Festival in 2017Therefore unsurprisingly, a recent HCY148 poll has shown that Fairy-like Whiskers Hua is listed as one of the most popular and very much missed HCY148. Jiu Jiu揪揪 (jiu1 jiu1) The word 揪 means pull.This is because this hairstyle requires the hair to be pulled into a ponytail at the top of the head.Jiu Jiu made his first public appearance during the filming of “Flowers on Trip“ in 2017 when Hua’s bangs was too long for his liking. So he pulled his hair into a ponytail to get them out of his face.However, Jiu Jiu’s appearance was short-lived as it lasted only for a few episodes before it was cut in the famous pot-haircut-session in episode 6 of “Flowers on Trip“.One of Jiu Jiu’s famous incidents was when he accidentally dropped the watermelon that he was carrying on his way back to the hotel while attempting runway walk. Today, this “watermelon tragedy” remains as one of the funniest scenes in this travelling show. Little Explodo小炸 (xiao3 zha4) From about 2016 to 2017, Hua’s hair was a bit longer, but not as long as Whiskers Hua (须须). And on his head, there were a few sharp hairs, like the horns of a little devil.This look was called “Little Explodo” because it looked like he had been through a bomb explosion. Broccoli Hua西兰花 (xi1 lan2 hua1) 西兰花 means broccoli, and its last Chinese character is the same as Hua Hua’s “花”This name was given because of Hua’s curly round head that resembles the head of broccoli.This hairstyle also gives off a fragile feel, which in turn enhances Hua’s delicate features.Broccoli Hua appeared only a few times and is often lamented as one of the HCY148 that will no longer return.First unveiled at the music show “Hi Song“ in 2014Most well-known for his appearance at the Chinese Top 10 Music Awards on 28th March 2016 where he sang “King and Beggar“ with Aska Yang.Then in the year 2016, Broccoli Hua officially appeared in full form and was also seen in “Fresh Sunday” show. Maruko Hua丸总 (wan2 zong3) The word 丸 (wan2) originates from the name Maruko, the main character of a well-known Japanese anime and manga series Chibi Maruko Chan.The name was given due to the resemblance between Hua Hua’ straight bangs and Maruko’s when Maruko had a disastrous haircut in Episode 936The word 总 (zong3) means CEO, thus the literal meaning of 丸总 is CEO Maruko as Maruko Hua exudes a boss-like aura.Maruko Hua was first seen in “Singer 2018“ Episode 8 singing “Flammable and Explosive”.Not only so, Maruko Hua was also spotted on several occasions such as Let Go My Baby! Season 3 Episode 7 and 8 and Conde Nast Traveler magazine.Maruko Hua is often mistaken for Rong Rong and Curly Hua as these two HCY148 do look similar in some ways such as the hair length and the slightly curled hair.So when you’re in doubt and confused, just look out for straight bangs paired with long hair, that’s none other than Maruko Hua! Fluffy Hua绒绒 (rong2 rong2) 绒 means soft and fluffy / velvet.Fluffy Hua’s 1st official appearance was in his Weibo video post when he sang “Half a Lifelong Romance” as fan benefit for reaching 20 million followers.With the soft and fluffy hairstyle, one just couldn’t help having the urge of tousling his hair. This childlike and gentle Fluffy Hua evoked a lot of maternal instincts among Martians, thus gaining him many mama fans.Fluffy Hua mainly appeared in “The Coming One S2“ (starting from episode 6).The most adorable moment of Fluffy Hua was during Shanghai Zebra Music Festival. The shy smile after he entered at the wrong beat when he was singing “For Forever“ remains a dearly-loved scene among fellow Martians. Sa Sa飒飒 (sa4 sa4) Sa Sa is also known as立风 (li4 feng1), which is a result of separating the character 飒 into two words.The word 飒 comes from the Chinese idiom - 英姿飒爽(ying1 zi1 sa4 shuang3) which means valiantly dashing.In a recent HCY148 popularity poll carried out in Weibo by fellow Martians, Sa Sa won the first place with 13,000 votes, indicating an overwhelming majority of the votes.Sa Sa was spotted in the year 2019 during Chengdu Bit &amp; Beat Fest (BBF), Shanghai Sun Music Festival and Qingdao Phoenix Music Festival. Not only so, Sa Sa also appeared in “The Coming One S3“, mesmerizing the audience with his charming looks.A particular cheeky incident of Sa Sa was when he responded to Martians’ request for him to trim his hair. In the video, he took out a pair of scissors and claimed that he’ll cut his hair. And…he did!! Just ONE single strand of hair. With the wide grin before he ended the video, it was mischievous Hua Hua indeed!In short, dashing Sa Sa is definitely the hearthrob of many Martians! After that, Hua became more and more sexy. Shi Ye十爷 (shi2 ye2) 十爷 means Master Ten.This nickname originates from 十辰于 (shi2 chen2 yu2), a name after removing the upper part of each Chinese character of his name 华晨宇, in correspond to his shaved head.Here’s the breakdown of each character: 华 - 化 = 十 晨 - 日 = 辰 宇 - 宀 = 于.The story behind this HCY148 is one where he kept his promise after failing to grab his own concert ticket for the third time.It all began when Hua tried to prove that his concert tickets were not that difficult to get as claimed by Martians. Confidently, he joined in the ticket-snatching fray but failed twice miserably. Before the third round of ticket sales, Hua pledged to shave his head should he return empty-handed for a third time. Finally when the day came, the story took an interesting twist when Hua admitted sheepishly on Weibo that he had overslept and missed the ticket sales. On October 26, Shi Ye first made his appearance in a selfie on Weibo, proving that he is a man true to his word and wowing everyone with his new look.Shi Ye’s first public appearance was during Tmall Double 11 Gala 2019, looking stunning in a silver windbreaker and beret.Shi Ye is also the one who held the “Mars Concert 2019“ in Haikou, taking everyone’s breath away with his manly presence.Today, on the 24th of July 2020, Hua surprised everyone when he revealed that Shi Ye is back in town again.Well, nothing is more appealing than a man who honors his words and this man is definitely Shi Ye. Curly Hua卷儿/卷鹅 (juan3 er2) 卷儿 is also known as 卷鹅 where the word 儿 (er2) is substituted by the word 鹅(e2) as they sound similar.卷 means curly where in this case, the hair tends to curl slightly at the end.Besides being one of the two fairy-like HCYs, Curly Hua is also loved for his aristocratic air especially in the 2018 Mars Concert trailer.Curly Hua made his official debut in “Singer 2018“ during the episode where he sang “Ordinary Path”.There are different types of hair styling for Curly Hua. At times, Hua will tie his hair up partially (in “Singer 2018“) and at times all up like a loose bun (in “The Coming One S2“ Episode 3).Another variation of Curly Hua is with the addition of single braids as seen at Running Shark Music Festival in 2019.A particular heartfelt moment of Curly Hua was when Curly Hua teared up in “The Coming One S2“ as he felt unfair for his team who got eliminated due to the unfair competition rules.In the year 2020, Curly Hua was crowned as King of the Singers, making him the first post-90s generation to earn this title and marking yet another milestone in Hua’s career path. Idiot智障障 (zhi4 zhang4 zhang4) Hua sometimes shows an expression that doesn’t look very smart.The reason is that he was so happy that he forgot to control his facial expressions.Fans joked: “We didn’t expect that it would be the Idiot who finally won the “Bird’s Nest” (Mars Concert 2018)! Congratulations to Idiot!” Stop Brother停哥 (ting2 ge1) After Mars Concert 2018, Hua was unable to rest even though he was in poor health and had to rush to perform in various locations.So fans went online to accuse Hua’s agency.When the situation gradually worsened and was on the verge of getting out of control, Hua posted the word “stop” on social media, and all fans immediately stopped accusing.On the same day, photos of Hua wearing a T-shirt with a pattern similar to a traffic stop sign were also taken by the media. Seagull Brother海鸥哥哥 (hai3 ou1 ge1 ge) In the lyrics of “Black and White Artist (黑白艺术家)“, Hua Chenyu compared anti-fans to ants and himself to a seagull, thus getting the name “Seagull Brother”. Eyebrow slit Hua断眉小华 (duan4 mei2 xiao3 hua2) Before Mars Concert 2021, Hua Chenyu released a promotional photo with eyebrow slit on SNS, and introduced himself as a new member of HCY148.When fans asked what this member’s name was, he answered, “Eyebrow slit Hua?”","link":"/hcy-148/"},{"title":"I Don&#39;t Care (我管你)","text":"Single released on June 15, 2015.

When the demo was heard the first time, Hua and his team all felt that the song was suitable for two people to sing, and Hua ‘s first thought was Yang Zongwei, as his tone was very suitable for this song. Dai Yuedong handed over two versions of the lyrics, but decided to use the first version which was suitable for two boys to sing. This song’s mixing was handled by the American Craig Burbidge, who specializes in Chinese love songs. 2.

About the songThe music video of “Aliens” tells the story of a misunderstood alien who breaks free of entrapment as if he is being reborn out of a shell and then gains a new life. The story begins with the dream of a teenager. In the atmosphere of a two-dimensional world, the teenager is besieged by a group of people, confronted by the strong ones, and tries to break free. People are shouting loudly. The teenager wakes up from the dream and opens the bedroom door into another space. Here he is rejected by people who are homogenized and numbed by the world. They are hostile and do not understand him. The teenager falls into another space in panic. He sees that young people’s arms, which should be raised, are strangled by questioning and slander instead. He struggles with all his might, tears things apart, and enters a launcher to a new space in life (representing the courage and self-consciousness that the alien needs to maintain). He gets this new life and conveys a sound of transcendence. The director of “Aliens” was affected a lot after hearing the song. According to his feelings after listening to it, such a script emerged within his mind, and he intentionally adopted unrealistic two-dimensional elements. It fit well with the rebellion and wildness hidden in Hua Chenyu’s heart. Two large sheds were rented at the filming site which was arranged like an exhibition hall of a postmodern installation filled with the tension of not only being held hostage by a knife, but also rows of arms hanging down, the depression of single beds in a dark room, and the filthy dark colors in the flickering light. The camera work of the whole film is fluid and rapid which tightly holds the audience’s attention. The image of the MV pursues a sense of granularity. Using large apertures, it shows the floating dust that depicts alternative dark violence. The director meticulously buried a lot of details such as the English phrase “Aliens fight against the world” on the tape, which means that every young person has had alternative independent thinking and expressions, but in the end, some succeed in struggles, and some are assimilated, which then reincarnates from generation to generation. The tape is constantly recording and playing back, which is very thought-provoking. Hua Chenyu returned to Beijing to record the final narration, “Unable to understand does not mean unable to listen. The victims who are defined as Aliens make vows with their silence.” This annotates the true meaning of the entire MV. Hua Chenyu’s team made a special trip to Taiwan for the filming of this music video, which lasted for 2 days. It was filmed all night until the morning of both days. The director had very high requirements on the picture quality. Two sets of clothes, shoes, and undershirts were prepared. One set was made dirty and the other was new which were switched between scenes. In Hua Chenyu’s dream as an alienated teenager, there are many fights. The director specially arranged a professional martial artist to guide Hua Hua’s martial arts movements the night before. The “cold and serious” martial arts instructor asked Hua Hua what sports he usually plays, whether he played basketball or football. Hua Hua shook his head. The instructor’s face turned more serious. During the shooting on the second day, when faced with the “siege” by more than 30 dancers, Hua Chenyu was kicked at the waist and head many times. But he was so dedicated that he didn’t call a stop one single time. Instead, his acting skills broke out. He punched, dodged, and perfectly performed the over-the-shoulder throw without special effects during the whole process. The fighting sequence was shot for nearly 4 hours. After the shooting, the serious martial arts instructor came over and gave a thumbs up, praising that it felt very good. Due to the excessive force used during the filming on the first day, Hua Chenyu returned to the hotel with a sore body at night. The next morning, every small movement became difficult due to severe muscle pain. But he still had to face the challenge of the wirework to continue with filming the part in the water. Hua Chenyu was hungry and tired because the filming lasted till 4 am in the morning. The director team warmly provided a lot of desserts to feed the foodie, Hua Hua. The filming of the “Aliens” MV allowed Hua Chenyu to show his talent in acting. It also encouraged people to look forward to more of his performances on the big screen in the future. At the same time, with its outstanding camera work, Hua Chenyu’s performance, and the depth of its meaning, this music video surpasses the average.2.

After a relationship ended, the morbid emotion became a catalyst. Wang Zi locked himself in the dark and wrote this heartache song. When he wrote the last sentence, he gradually felt relieved. In the process of choosing songs one by one, Hua Chenyu heard the demo, liked it very much and made a reservation. Two months later, he decided to include it into the album. The lyricist Xiaohan filled in two version of the lyrics from her own feeling of the demo, and finally decided to use “Antonyms”. “Your antonym is me, and my synonym is wrong”, “It’s not that the word is poor, nor is it ignorant, it’s just pain, and it’s secretly rushing in the body”, the pain of love lose was clearly shown on the paper. Producer Bernard Zheng arranged the composition from quiet to dark, from simple to incremental, using a simple combination of piano as main instrument, with the string music gradually coming in afterwards. The bass of the piano in the prelude slowly fell down one by one, and the prelude of the whole song was gradually opened. The string music gradually entered. The arrangement seems to be simple, but is ingenuity, the piano, the vocal, the string are either in charge or as assistant, intertwined with each other, the lines are clear, leaving more space for voice performance to Hua Chenyu’s voca 2.

About the song“Mayfly” is composed by Hua Chenyu, and lyrics by Dai Yuedong, the song won the “Top 10 Golden Song of the Year” at the Annual Asian Song Charts Awards in 2016. The song was written at a night when Hua Chenyu locked himself in a small room. The lyricist Yuedong, was deeply attracted into the melody like trapped into a wormhole, when he was listening to the demon. This feeling reminded him of the Mayfly. Mayfly is one of the most primitive winged insects, with a short life span of only one day. But in this short life, it can bloom into the most brilliant glory, which make us human being realised that cherish every moment of the present, is the most important thing. The lyricist then decided to use “Mayfly” this small creature as a concept, to create this song. When the arranger Bernard Zheng heard the demon, his first imagination was the pent-up space and loneliness before the rain, so he added more electronic sound with electronic effects of the piano, and retain the residual sound from a string. 2.

This Norwegian Light’s rising star has made her mark in the music scene with its illusory and deep, clear and emotional vocal lines, and her songs have been greatly appreciated by Katy Perry. Although this song was written by a girl, its jumping, psychedelic style was very interesting, and matched Hua Chenyu’s style very well. It was well known that Aurora Aksne normally put her songs into her own albums, not for others to cover, the team decided to give it try. After communicating on copyright, the team got this talented girl’s song, then this “Escape from Utopia” was born. “Utopia” represents the beautiful world in the will of human mind, but the seemingly beautiful reality has a lot of constraints, the seemingly gorgeous has many holes, people want to escape. Just as the life of an idol, behind the spotlight is the life that has been edited. After collaboration of seven songs, including the song We Are All Lonely of the first album and The Mayfly of the second album, the collaboration of Dai Yuedong and Hua Chenyu has become very tacit. Obviously, this time Dai Yuedong had a good grasp of the theme, named the song “Escape from utopia”, the lyrics wrote about the false hollow feeling of the urban people being pushed away by the secular rules, as if the life is written by the invisible pen, expressing the desire to break free from the secular frame, re-control of their own life. And this theme is very much in tune with Aurora Aksne’s psychedelic style. The arranger Bernard Zheng, highlighted the intensity of the rhythm and the distinction of the tone, to build a different world from the reality, both beautiful pure, but also deep dark. The electronic music interspersed in the middle is extremely depressed, wanting to break through everything by the real roar of life, and to a large extent to let the emotions soothing. The whole song’s psychedelic tone and changing drum point collision, in which the rebellious, struggling, and self-talk, let the “book man” finally make the decision, by himself, to go out, escape from utopia, restore the appearance of life. 2.

The lyrics are full of naughty colors, life is regarded as an interesting zoo with extraordinary imagination. Hua Chenyu also sang in a special way, making this song even more lively. At the “Mars Concert“, Hua Chenyu always sang “oiaioiaioiaiaio” with a random melody, asking the fans in the audience to repeat it. The melody gradually became more and more complex, and always ended on a high note that the fans could not sing, thus becoming a reason for him to laugh at his fans. 2. VideosMars Concert 2023 3.
