{"posts":[{"title":"Why Nobody Fights","text":"1. About the songReleased on August 15 2014. Toward the end of June 2014, when work on the album Quasimodo’s Gift was in its final stages, Hua Chenyu wrote “Why Nobody Fights” which was inspired by a most unlikely source. In an interview, Hua stated that the inspiration for this song came after watching a soccer match during his travels in Europe. He wanted to dedicate the song to his audience to encourage them to be true to themselves. Hua Chenyu takes great pride in the fact that he wrote the only line of lyrics in this song. He has only one other lyricist credit in his four-album repertoire. With each repetition of that line (why nobody fights), the delivery is slightly different. As a result, recording it wasn’t easy and it took several days. Bernard Zheng, now Hua’s long-time producer, recruited the renowned American mixing engineer, music producer, and multi-instrumentalist, Ken Lewis for the downmixing. Zheng initially invited some friends to sing the chorus, which in a concert setting would be sung by the audience. However, after listening to the rough cut, Hua felt that it was too perfect and decided to go in a different direction. To create the mysterious “choir-inspired” feeling that he wanted, many people would need to participate. Hua then recommended inviting his fans to participate. One hundred fans gathered at a large orchestral recording studio to complete the accompaniment and achieve the dramatic choral effect he had hoped for. 2.

About the songReleased in 2014. The interlude music for the TV drama “My Sunshine (何以笙箫默)”.This song is included in the first album “Quasimodo’s Gift“. “Glimmer” just like its name, is a soft and gentle song performed with exceptional tenderness by Hua Chenyu. A piano accompaniment is all that’s needed as he sings this simple melody. The music is sometimes quiet, sometimes it swells. “Glimmer” is intricate and intense, but without the rock edge and technical high notes Hua is known for. This delicate arrangement highlights the beauty and power of Hua Chenyu’s voice and demonstrates his careful control. Still, Hua permits the subtle emotion of the song to shine, which allows the listener to feel that glimmer of light. On April 20, 2018, Hua Chenyu performed this iconic piece during the post-festival of the music competition program “Singer 2018“ He also had collaborations with the Chinese pianist Lang Lang in various performances. On September 25, 2022, during the online concert “火星乐章 (Mars Chapter)“ celebrating his 9th debut anniversary, Hua Chenyu arranged 11 songs in collaboration with a symphony orchestra and choir. 2.

About the songReleased on August 26, 2014. After listening to the demo for “Ashes From Fireworks”, Hua Chenyu felt that the delicate melody was quite suitable for his voice and decided to include it in this album. Xi Lou wrote the song in 2012 to comfort himself while going through a difficult time. The song was similar to the deeply personal song, “I Am What I Am“, covered by Hua Chenyu during the Super Boy 2013 competition. “Ashes From Fireworks” was not the typical kind of song that people were used to hearing. When Bernard Zheng received the demo for “Ashes From Fireworks”, he felt it was a fortuitous coincidence as he knew the composer, Xi Lou. Zheng felt that he and Hua Chenyu shared a common understanding of music, so in order to preserve the original feeling of the song, he asked Xi Lou to help with the arrangement. Xi not only helped complete the second arrangement of the song, but ultimately stayed throughout the entire recording process. This process included five mixing modifications and Xi also recorded the harmony. In keeping with the conceptual ideas of the album, the theme of “smoke” was used throughout the arrangement and lyrics. Albert Leung, a judge for the 2014 Spring Festival Gala, was deeply impressed by Hua’s singing in the competition. Leung was invited and immediately agreed to write lyrics for this album. In preparation for writing, he watched many videos and read many articles about Hua. Following the official recording, Leung changed the lyrics for “Ashes From Fireworks” an additional three times to ensure they represented the true feeling of Hua Chenyu’s inner world, and also to ensure they conformed to his high standards. In order to achieve the desired psychedelic effect of time and space, Hua Chenyu recorded the song so many times that he became hoarse. The end result was that the song appeared to be much easier to sing than it actually was. 2. VideosMV “Mars Chapter” Symphony Shanghai Zebra Music Festival 2018 3.

About the songReleased on August 29 2014. As soon as Hua Chenyu arrived home one day, he sat down at the piano and began to compose. “Let You Go” was the result. Beginning with the first harmony, the melody was already established, and Hua Chenyu was able to record the music as he played and sang. In his own words, it was “a song written in a song’s time.” After listening to the demo, Hua’s producer Bernard Zheng agreed that the chords he used and the emphatic way he sang “let you go” in English suited the electronic rock style. The arrangement of the song has two distinct parts; the first part of the song has the feeling of restraint, which allows the listener to focus on the vocals and the simple piano accompaniment. In the second part of the song, the restraint fades and energy begins to build. The long introduction creates a feeling of suppression until the end of the interlude where, following the rhythm of the drums and the incorporation of other instruments and electronic sounds, the tones are built and layered to create a theatrical conflict. The singer’s words in Chinese and English, “let you go, 别靠近我 (stay away from me),” intensifies that contrast. During audio mixing, Ken Lewis minimized the rock elements of the song, strengthening instead the electronic components, and finally toning down the guitar. 2.

About the songReleased on September 19, 2014. “Traveling” is one of several songs chosen by Hua Chenyu which were composed by the Danish band, Dúné. He liked their songs so much that he actually chose four for his first album. The vocals, sound effects, and instrumentation come together to make “Traveling” sound ethereal, transparent, and psychedelic; as though traveling in outer space. The lyrics describe a journey through life where Hua Chenyu encourages listeners to follow that journey with courage and youthful vitality. The song conveys the positive energy of youth, a new generation of rock style in comparison to the previous heavy and rather angry expression of the former generation. The studio version incorporates a multitude of electronic sound effects, and although perhaps not as popular as “Ashes From Fireworks“ or “I Don’t Care“, “Traveling” is an extremely challenging song to sing with a wide range and many different transitions from one register to another. 2.

About the songReleased on September 19, 2014. A somber melody and uncomplicated lyrics bring a kind of dark mood to this song. It portrays a truth that resonates deep in the heart: we are all lonely. At some point in our lives we all feel alone, our dreams lost, invisible, and unappreciated. We feel the singer’s heartbreak as he exposes his pain. His voice weeps as he describes the falling rain and the lonely road home. The interlude transports us there with him as the sound of the wailing guitar and the singer’s dejected tone accompany us. As the song ends, we feel a final sigh in the gentle tones of the piano and guitar. 2. VideosMars Concert 2016 Official Video 3.

About the songReleased on September 19, 2014. “Bedtime Story” is not what you would call a “big” song, with only a guitar for accompaniment; however, the lyrics are simple and touching. They relate the fairy tale story of a princess who falls in love with a frog, marries him against the family objections, and then they go away to live happily ever after. The novice songwriter, Ronald Tsui, spent a few years in the UK and was influenced by 90s pop, R&amp;B, and soul, but was focused on two things; simplicity and love. The writer of the lyrics in Chinese, Dai Yuedong, emailed them in the middle of the night to Hua, laughingly pointing out the frogs, the prince, and the fairy tale-like aspects of the subject matter. It was love at first sight for Hua Hua. 2. VideosMars Concert 2016 Official Video 3.

About the songReleased on September 12, 2014. Hua Chenyu’s inspiration for “Quasimodo’s Gift” came after seeing an abstract painting in a church in Italy during the European tour of the reality show “Divas Hit the Road (花儿与少年)“. At that time, because of the program’s regulations, mobile phones had to be turned in to the producers; as a result, he had no device on which to record the melody. After returning to China, he explained that he was not able to remember the melody, but two months later while composing songs for his album, he suddenly recalled that painting and immediately recorded the music on the piano. When writing this song, the picture in Hua Chenyu’s mind was of a church at night, with a lonely sufferer kneeling in front of a single candle. “Quasimodo’s Gift” is in some ways classical in style, but is still infused with popular musical elements. Bernard Zheng produced the music so that the painful feelings evoked by the demo became more beautiful and sad. He also included the sounds one would experience on a dark and rainy night, such as thunder, lightening, and church bells. These environmental sounds immediately bring to mind a lonely singer in the dark. It took Hua Chenyu only about two hours to record this song. 2. VideosShort Movie MV “Mars Chapter” Symphony 3.

In order to make the song more explosive and could be sung with the audience, he invited his friend Zuo Li to try out various a guitar riffs, to complete the creation of the song. Hua composed this song for live performance, hoping to sing it with the audience, so he often performs it at music festivals and other events. This song, along with several other rock songs, was dubbed the “commercial performance package” by fans. In 2015, the song was selected as the advertising jingle for Ballantine’s, a Scottish whiskey brand.Then, on May 30, while recording a remixed version (Real-Me version), in order to highlight the spirit of the song, Hua specially invited a hundred fans to join him in recording the chorus part. On February 23, 2018, Hua Chenyu sang this masterpiece on EP7 of “Singer 2018“. Although the performance stage was small, Hua’s musical appeal gradually turned it into a rock venue. On September 25, 2022, at the online concert “Mars Chapter“ to celebrate the ninth anniversary of his debut, Hua Chenyu collaborated with the symphony orchestra and choir to rearrange 11 songs. This song was used as a bonus track and became his first attempt at a cappella. 2.

The song was written at a night when Hua Chenyu locked himself in a small room. The lyricist Yuedong, was deeply attracted into the melody like trapped into a wormhole, when he was listening to the demon. This feeling reminded him of the Mayfly. Mayfly is one of the most primitive winged insects, with a short life span of only one day. But in this short life, it can bloom into the most brilliant glory, which make us human being realised that cherish every moment of the present, is the most important thing. The lyricist then decided to use “Mayfly” this small creature as a concept, to create this song.

Be included in Hua Chenyu’s 2nd album “Aliens“. 1. About the song“Escape from Utopia”, composed by Aurora Aksnes, the lyrics by Dai Yuedong. This Norwegian Light’s rising star has made her mark in the music scene with its illusory and deep, clear and emotional vocal lines, and her songs have been greatly appreciated by Katy Perry. Although this song was written by a girl, its jumping, psychedelic style was very interesting, and matched Hua Chenyu’s style very well. It was well known that Aurora Aksne normally put her songs into her own albums, not for others to cover, the team decided to give it try. After communicating on copyright, the team got this talented girl’s song, then this “Escape from Utopia” was born. “Utopia” represents the beautiful world in the will of human mind, but the seemingly beautiful reality has a lot of constraints, the seemingly gorgeous has many holes, people want to escape. Just as the life of an idol, behind the spotlight is the life that has been edited. After collaboration of seven songs, including the song We Are All Lonely of the first album and The Mayfly of the second album, the collaboration of Dai Yuedong and Hua Chenyu has become very tacit. Obviously, this time Dai Yuedong had a good grasp of the theme, named the song “Escape from utopia”, the lyrics wrote about the false hollow feeling of the urban people being pushed away by the secular rules, as if the life is written by the invisible pen, expressing the desire to break free from the secular frame, re-control of their own life. And this theme is very much in tune with Aurora Aksne’s psychedelic style. The arranger Bernard Zheng, highlighted the intensity of the rhythm and the distinction of the tone, to build a different world from the reality, both beautiful pure, but also deep dark. The electronic music interspersed in the middle is extremely depressed, wanting to break through everything by the real roar of life, and to a large extent to let the emotions soothing. The whole song’s psychedelic tone and changing drum point collision, in which the rebellious, struggling, and self-talk, let the “book man” finally make the decision, by himself, to go out, escape from utopia, restore the appearance of life. 2.

After a relationship ended, the morbid emotion became a catalyst. Wang Zi locked himself in the dark and wrote this heartache song. When he wrote the last sentence, he gradually felt relieved. In the process of choosing songs one by one, Hua Chenyu heard the demo, liked it very much and made a reservation. Two months later, he decided to include it into the album. The lyricist Xiaohan filled in two version of the lyrics from her own feeling of the demo, and finally decided to use “Antonyms”. “Your antonym is me, and my synonym is wrong”, “It’s not that the word is poor, nor is it ignorant, it’s just pain, and it’s secretly rushing in the body”, the pain of love lose was clearly shown on the paper. Producer Bernard Zheng arranged the composition from quiet to dark, from simple to incremental, using a simple combination of piano as main instrument, with the string music gradually coming in afterwards. The bass of the piano in the prelude slowly fell down one by one, and the prelude of the whole song was gradually opened. The string music gradually entered. The arrangement seems to be simple, but is ingenuity, the piano, the vocal, the string are either in charge or as assistant, intertwined with each other, the lines are clear, leaving more space for voice performance to Hua Chenyu’s voca 2.

About the songReleased on September 17, 2014. “Immortal” is another song originally composed by indie rock band Dúné and chosen by Hua Chenyu. Given that song selection was made from over 20,000 demos, it’s clear that Hua truly loves the music of this band, as he chose several of their songs in this first album. The fast-paced musical style of “Immortal” is metal, rhythmic, and rocky. There are distinct stylistic differences between the more electronic verses and the rock-style chorus. Bernard Zheng’s arrangement emphasized the guitar segments with a very interesting interlude. The vocals are challenging for the singer, as they are high in the treble range with explosive segments. Hua Hua received praise from the sound engineers during the recording process as he was not only able to sing in that high range for many hours at a time, but also returned the next day rested and able to give his best. The young and wild attitude of the song arises from the combination of melody, instrumentation and Hua’s powerful singing. The wonderful lyrics composed by Guo De Ziyi are determined, proud and unyielding; echoed by the wild cries of a princely, passionate young man. 2. VideosMV Mars Concert 2016 Official Video 3.

About the songThe music video of “Aliens” tells the story of a misunderstood alien who breaks free of entrapment as if he is being reborn out of a shell and then gains a new life. The story begins with the dream of a teenager. In the atmosphere of a two-dimensional world, the teenager is besieged by a group of people, confronted by the strong ones, and tries to break free. People are shouting loudly. The teenager wakes up from the dream and opens the bedroom door into another space. Here he is rejected by people who are homogenized and numbed by the world. They are hostile and do not understand him. The teenager falls into another space in panic. He sees that young people’s arms, which should be raised, are strangled by questioning and slander instead. He struggles with all his might, tears things apart, and enters a launcher to a new space in life (representing the courage and self-consciousness that the alien needs to maintain). He gets this new life and conveys a sound of transcendence. The director of “Aliens” was affected a lot after hearing the song. According to his feelings after listening to it, such a script emerged within his mind, and he intentionally adopted unrealistic two-dimensional elements. It fit well with the rebellion and wildness hidden in Hua Chenyu’s heart. Two large sheds were rented at the filming site which was arranged like an exhibition hall of a postmodern installation filled with the tension of not only being held hostage by a knife, but also rows of arms hanging down, the depression of single beds in a dark room, and the filthy dark colors in the flickering light. The camera work of the whole film is fluid and rapid which tightly holds the audience’s attention. The image of the MV pursues a sense of granularity. Using large apertures, it shows the floating dust that depicts alternative dark violence. The director meticulously buried a lot of details such as the English phrase “Aliens fight against the world” on the tape, which means that every young person has had alternative independent thinking and expressions, but in the end, some succeed in struggles, and some are assimilated, which then reincarnates from generation to generation. The tape is constantly recording and playing back, which is very thought-provoking. Hua Chenyu returned to Beijing to record the final narration, “Unable to understand does not mean unable to listen. The victims who are defined as Aliens make vows with their silence.” This annotates the true meaning of the entire MV. Hua Chenyu’s team made a special trip to Taiwan for the filming of this music video, which lasted for 2 days. It was filmed all night until the morning of both days. The director had very high requirements on the picture quality. Two sets of clothes, shoes, and undershirts were prepared. One set was made dirty and the other was new which were switched between scenes. In Hua Chenyu’s dream as an alienated teenager, there are many fights. The director specially arranged a professional martial artist to guide Hua Hua’s martial arts movements the night before. The “cold and serious” martial arts instructor asked Hua Hua what sports he usually plays, whether he played basketball or football. Hua Hua shook his head. The instructor’s face turned more serious. During the shooting on the second day, when faced with the “siege” by more than 30 dancers, Hua Chenyu was kicked at the waist and head many times. But he was so dedicated that he didn’t call a stop one single time. Instead, his acting skills broke out. He punched, dodged, and perfectly performed the over-the-shoulder throw without special effects during the whole process. The fighting sequence was shot for nearly 4 hours. After the shooting, the serious martial arts instructor came over and gave a thumbs up, praising that it felt very good. Due to the excessive force used during the filming on the first day, Hua Chenyu returned to the hotel with a sore body at night. The next morning, every small movement became difficult due to severe muscle pain. But he still had to face the challenge of the wirework to continue with filming the part in the water. Hua Chenyu was hungry and tired because the filming lasted till 4 am in the morning. The director team warmly provided a lot of desserts to feed the foodie, Hua Hua. The filming of the “Aliens” MV allowed Hua Chenyu to show his talent in acting. It also encouraged people to look forward to more of his performances on the big screen in the future. At the same time, with its outstanding camera work, Hua Chenyu’s performance, and the depth of its meaning, this music video surpasses the average. 2.

About the song As the first song of Hua Chenyu’s for public welfare, he admitted that this is not only “the tragedy song for human being”, but also “the love letter to the earth”. In the process of filling in the lyrics, Hua Chenyu’s original abstractive idea made many words difficult to fit. The lyricist Xiao Junfeng, came up with the form of Hua Chenyu’s dialogue with God in the main song. “Abandoned trauma, did he see?” neglected sorrow, did he hear it? Silent prayer, does he know? A child without a home, will he take care of him? “The word “he” chosen here is the “God” that the singer wants to talk to (“He” means a third-person pronoun for “God”), this kind of continuous platoon questioning and complaining sent questions and complaints straight into the depths of the life. Hua Chenyu was shocked when he saw those lyrics, those were what he wanted to say but couldn’t express by himself, fully in line with his original intention. The lyrics of the anthem was written by Dai Yuedong, to express the singer’s desire to change the reality. Dai Yuedong thought of the documentary [the salt of the earth] by Wim. Wenders and Julia no. Salgado. “The Salt of the Earth” is originally comes from “Salt and Light” in Chapter 5.2 of the Gospel of New Testament, and Jesus praises his disciples as the light of the salt of the earth, the place of positive will, symbolizing compassion and hope. This final part showed a clean soul, after reading the human greed which gave birth to the death of grief, chose to return to the nature. After the new elements were added to the instrument during the production process, the song was sent to the United States for late-stage mixing and completed the revision of the multi-version mix. 2.

He looked at the bustling crowd and a thought suddenly caught on him that maybe everyone plays an unknown role in their life, and then he wrote the demo of this song. This is a very theatrical piece of work, with variable melody and integration of multiple elements and layers. There are rhythm changes showing hidden murderous themes, compassionate melody, and progressive rap containing classical Chinese elements. The song echoes the fluctuation of the storyline in the movie “Line Walker”, making the music itself full of mysterious feelings. In the seemingly casual singing, Hua Chenyu also incorporates elements of Chinese folk songs, which add some oriental hint to the English lyrics of “Here We Are”. 2.

Be included in Hua Chenyu’s 3rd album “H“.Theme song of the documentary “The Great Shokunin (了不起的匠人) Season 3”. 1. About the songThe song was inspired by a peculiar dream. In the dream, Hua Chenyu ran all the way through the darkness and reached a white world. There he saw a group of white angels dancing and playing. He woke up in the middle of night and wrote this song in the dark. Hua Chenyu communicated specially with Dai Yuedong, and felt the story could be expressed well in an anthropomorphic way. Dai Yuedong finally chose the symbolic purity “Giant Deer” as the lyrics image, because “Giant Deer” itself represents “weird dream”. In order to maintain the sanctity and ethereal inspiration of the song, Zheng Nan specially recruited a string band of more than 40 members for accompaniment. The harmony in the song is all from Hua Chenyu’s vocals. Hua Chenyu also deliberately adopted an abnormal harmony singing method. “Giant Deer” begins with a piano solo, and then joined with wind instruments, from quiet to crescendo and then back to quiet, the continuous changes of multiple groups of high notes and harmony create a beautiful and holy atmosphere. DEMO’s song title was “Angel”. 2. VideosMars Concert 2021 FanCam MV Recording 3.

Be included in Hua Chenyu’s 3rd album “H“.Promotional song for the movie “The Warriors Gate”. 1. About the song“To Be Free” is a promotional song created by Hua Chenyu for the movie “The Warriors Gate”. The film crew found Yin Yue, who had cooperated with Hua Chenyu, to write a tailor-made lyrics for the song, and it went through several drafts. The main melody of the song was originally completed by the piano, but Hua Chenyu felt that the piano was not “burning” enough, so he invited his friend Zuo Li home to help, and finally completed the demo with a guitar. When communicating for the arrangement with producer Bernard Zheng, Hua Chenyu hoped to incorporate choir in the verse, when Bernard Zheng suggested using children’s chorus, an agreement was achieved immediately on using children’s chorus in the verse to highlight the theme. The style of the song is passionate and powerful, and the melody is quite exotic. The prelude starts with intermittent Bass, the smooth and fully powerful drum part, together with Hua Chenyu’s magnetic tone and lazy to explosive vocal style, it shows the singer’s confusion, hesitation, rebellion, and anger towards the world. The lyrics fully represent the image from the film. it not only describes the process of a cowardly and confused teenager growing into a warrior, but also analyzes the emotional changes in the characters’ hearts, and shows many microcosms of the real world as well. 2.

Be included in Hua Chenyu’s 3rd album “H“. 1. About the song“Miles Away from Lonely” was created by Hua Chenyu while he was on vacation in Japan. He was walking in a tunnel and felt very lonely, so he had the inspiration to create the demo and named it “On the Road”. DEMO’s lyrics are casually sung with meaningless pronunciation that sounds like Japanese. After communicating with the lyricist, the title of the song was finally set as “Miles Away from Loneliness”. Lyricism is the mainstay of the song. Adopting his singing style for ballad songs, Hua Chenyu uses an euphemistic airy and soft tone in this song. The melodious vocal fits perfectly with the orchestration, creating a relaxing and natural feeling. Hua uses a tone which is a shade deeper but still clear, exemplifies a touch of sadness in the melody. Crescendo methods were used in many parts along the song, each long note has a crescendo treatment, chorus background is also designed from soft to strong and followed by a strong ending, so that the high and low notes are not overly explosive but very heart soothing. Starting in 2021, Mars Concert had been upgraded to an outdoor rock festival. Hua put his rock songs in the more exciting Evening Show, and put his early songs and some pop songs in the more relaxed Matinee. This song had also become one of Matinee’s fixed repertoire in unplugged form, and Hua sung it with Zuo Li almost every time. 2. VideosMars Concert 2023 - Matinee DEMO “On the Road” 3.

Hua specially invited American singer Ruiyan Mijiaer to write the lyrics. According to the melody of the song, Ruiyan Mijiaer improvised the entire English lyric in one go. While the standard English pronunciation became the biggest challenge for Hua Chenyu, he completed the recording of the song in English under the guidance of Ruiyan Mijiaer. The lyrics have a touch of sadness, while the brisk drum rhythm on the arrangement is the backbone and soul of the song. In B1 section，the triple tone at the end of each sentence advances layer after layer, giving the whole song a unique style. Section C is even more interesting. The bouncting “Oh” intervenes with the drum beats in the repeated chorus, making the overwhelming chorus sound amazing. Classical main chords, transparent falsetto, occasionally raging guitars together with gentle and delicate vocal bring comfort and joy to the listeners The Chinese pronunciation of the song title is similar to “Hua hua loves me”. At “MARS CONCERT 2018“, Hua Chenyu personally admitted this nickname and then made a request: “If you change the title of the song to ‘Hua hua loves me’, it will be your turn to sing! I just need to fly around in the sky!” Then he sang the song while flying above the stadium seats on a wire that could rotate 360 degrees. 2.

About the songAs a hard-hitting track in Hua Chenyu’s fourth solo album “NEW WORLD“, expresses a unique perspective on the debate of mankind’s relationship with nature and the awe and respect towards the vigorous tenacity of life. and a discussion of the relationship between man and nature and awe of life and natural forces with a different philosophical perspective. This is a song that portrays the philosophical complexion of recurrent natural forces and a song that conveys encompassing love towards all life. His writing of is the longest period Hua Chenyu had taken to compose a song. It took an entire month in alternating bursts of intense composing at the piano and long periods of rest and clearing of his mind. The lyrics describe the barbarity of mankind in contrast with the pureness of an untamed soul. The bullfighter uses a spear to pierce the flesh of the bull to enrage and incite its feral attacks and in the end, kills it thereby demonstrating the superiority and nobleness of humanity. To Hua Chenyu, “Bullfight” is a sorrowful struggle with no winner. Whichever side that wins, bullfighter or bull, the other faces death. The song utilizes brutal satire to invoke introspection on life itself condensed into a Bullfight scene, and at the end gives us his answer: “Following our kind nature – the last pride and chance for the victory of mankind” in hopes of reawakening and resonating with the listeners’ inherent propensity for kindness. The MV is envisioned by Hua Chenyu and presented in a combination of CG and animation. At the shooting site of the MV, there is only Hua Chenyu acting on his lonesome, using his immersive imagination to achieve the actions and atmosphere required by the director. To convincingly act as a bullfighter, the director arranged for a Spanish coach to teach Hua Chenyu the professional moves of a bullfighter and guide his pose and movements in “Bullfight” scenes. Hua Chenyu was an eager and quick learner, and sweat and grinding hard work went behind every simple flick of the red cloth. The MV was produced by a Japanese production team, directed by Mitsunori Yokobori, and animated by Yoshiki Imazu. On February 14, 2020, Hua Chenyu enthusiastically sang “Bullfight (斗牛)”, the main song of his unreleased 4th album “NEW WORLD“, on EP2 of the Singing Talent Show Contest “Singer 2020“. On September 25, 2022, at the online concert “Mars Chapter“ celebrating the 9th anniversary of his debut, Hua Chenyu rearranged 11 songs in collaboration with a symphony orchestra and a choir. 2.

Officially released on December 4, 2019. Be included in Hua Chenyu’s 4th album “NEW WORLD“.It has broken the record for the number of digital single sales in China. 1. About the songMars Triology - Part One A work that calls for a better understanding of the feelings of depressive disorder patients. On April 3, 2020, Hua Chenyu performed this song on EP9 of the Singing Talent Show Contest “Singer 2020“. On September 25, 2022, at the online concert “Mars Chapter“ celebrating the 9th anniversary of his debut, Hua Chenyu rearranged 11 songs in collaboration with a symphony orchestra and a choir. When we first encountered Hua’s music, we were deeply attracted to his carefree spirit expressed in songs like “I Don’t Care“ and “Aliens“. He is so cool that I feel a volcano could be chilled instantly by one look from him. As a child growing up without attentive parents, it’s understandable that he developed a coolness, a psychological mechanism to protect himself. He trained himself not to pay too much attention to social interactions, which was a mostly negative experience in his early childhood. He can isolate himself in a bubble and even enjoy being alone. An old Chinese saying is “When heaven is about to place a big responsibility on a person, it must first put him through ordeals and tribulations so as to break his will; subdue his spirit; exhaust his muscles; starve his flesh.” Out of Hua’s solitude and struggles, evident in songs like “Fake Monk“, he came out a strong-willed person with an extraordinary mind-frame and vision which have guided him through his early rise to fame without drowning his unique voice in an ocean of commercialization. He was able to hold on to his core beliefs and confidently handle earlier waves of slander in his career using this defense mechanism. In his own words, “No matter what the circumstance is, I can always make myself comfortable.” This confidence emanates from Hua’s understanding of Buddhist teachings: to gain enlightenment is to see through one’s own self-nature (the universal man not eclipsed by ego). Unenlightenment is the source of confusion and pain. By overcoming our ego, we can start to comprehend the causality (the cause and effect relationship of all things) in the world so that we will no longer be subjected to the whims of our irrational emotions and be condemned in eternal cycles of Samsara (incarnations). “Not pleased by external gains, not saddened by personal losses” has been the gentlemanly pursuit in the spirit of this philosophy. In other words, if you are enlightened, you will not be swayed by emotions and will stay worry-free. In earlier interviews such as “Who Am I Promotion” in 2015, he professed his belief perfectly: I am someone with zero worries, I have no confusion. I fully accept myself. I’ve come to understand that there’s nothing in this world that is the most important. When I was young, I was also someone keen on my dreams. But I don’t have any dreams now. I don’t dream to be a celebrity. I don’t have dreams in music. I mean… From what I understand, most people are pursuing happiness. But that’s not what I’m looking for. I only strive to have no worries. There’s nothing that you have to have and cannot let go of. “Letting go” is the mantra of Buddhism which means to let go of our ego filled with desires. Our dreams are often the reflection of our desires, so within the Buddhist belief system, it’s better not to dream. We should not only let go of our ego but also, to a large extent, our social being. This will also impose limitations on our mind due to the social norms that our social being gravitated towards, which is a hindrance to enlightenment. Given the non-attachment attitude of Buddhism, Hua developed a cold-eyed perspective on social relationships between people. He said, “For me, the relationship between people is just about using and being used by others. Since I don’t need to use others, why would I let others use me?” It is a blunt, and a bit of a detached, attitude. In summary, at that time, he had a very, very cool mentality. What has changed between then and now? The nonchalant rocker voice that sings “I don’t care what you think, taking me as a fool or a joke, I am my own expression” has changed to “I once thought of leaving… It’s because of those narratives, those stances and those inflicted pains” in “I’m Here AKA I Really Want to Love This World”. From not giving a damn about other people’s opinions to getting hurt by others’ narratives, we can’t help asking, has he lost his cool? The answer probably lies in Hua’s suppressed social being. Being detached from the crowd gives you freedom of mind and a carefree spirit, however, you also need to suppress your social being. That emotional and vulnerable social being needs love and support from family and friends as well as the approval of society, the very opposite of his cool persona. When life sails smoothly, his social being will not be too aggrieved and can be kept at bay to a degree. Hegel’s famous dialectical theory is that the antithesis of a thesis is bound to develop and emerge. So, as the antithesis of his detached being, his suppressed social being inevitably emerged in an unexpected way when it was wronged by his circumstances and ignored by his cool persona for too long. His earlier enlightenment offered no solution in this respect and it caught up with him in a big way–he was depressed. I can only imagine the shock he experienced when his former belief system was crushed so relentlessly. After all, he can’t stay worry-free and unbothered by his sense of being wronged. Years of mindfulness practice still couldn’t fend off his tumultuous emotions. Being honest, he exposed his vulnerabilities to us without reservation and made his struggles relatable to all of us. Who isn’t dealing with a suppressed identity of their own? We are dialectical in nature to begin with. When we profess one being, then our other beings will be suppressed. If we don’t recognize our hidden selves and take care of them, then some of them will force their way to our consciousness and wreak havoc. What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger. Let’s not forget that there is still the third part in Hegel’s theory: after the antithesis emerges, the thesis and antithesis will synthesize and a new thesis will emerge. So out of this depression, we can see that a new Hua Hua has already appeared. He has reconnected with his social being, he is close to his friends, his world is suddenly “filled with colors when smiles bloom”. He is taking care of his social being more than ever while still holding on to his former beliefs about universal perspective and universal love. He has deconstructed his old world and started a brand new world. No matter how gloomy his songs are, they always end on a brighter note and his struggles are never pointless. He always emerges stronger like he has a thousand times before when growing up. We can count on him for that. I am looking forward to witnessing his journey of self-exploration and discovery because it has always been an upward spiral. Counter darkness with gentleness, dispel depression with understandings, usher in beauties with a smile— these are what Hua Chenyu is looking forward to. As the song specially written for people suffering depression in the “Trilogy of Mars“, This song conveys Hua Chenyu’s sensibility and understanding of this world and his respect towards and his love of life. We hope everyone can meet the beauty of this world in love and goodness. Hua Chenyu specifically posted a commentary on the song on social media (Weibo): “I’m Here AKA I Really Want to Love This World” is the first song in the Mars trilogy I wrote this year. It’s about depression. People who are suffering depression are very afraid of being considered as “quite normal” and being ignored. When a day comes that he is willing to tell you that he may be sick, that proves he is taking you as a very important person to him. Therefore at that time, please don’t say as a first reaction things like “I feel you are fine, you look quite normal usually.” Please be aware that right after you say that, it may let him have anxiety towards the world and people. If you are a friend who is about to be sick or is already sick, I really hope this song can offer some warmth. If you are having a great life, I really hope that you can offer care to friends who are or about to be sick. 2.

Be included in Hua Chenyu’s 4th album “NEW WORLD“. 1. About the songMars Triology - Part Three First duet song since his debut, and expressing Hua Chenyu’s bond with his fans, whose nickname is Martian (ET). To Love Is to UnderstandIn the promotion trailer for “Conversations With Children of Mars”, we see this quote: “The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved.” It seems that Hua did his soul-searching and decided that out of the many theories about the significance of life, to love and to be loved is what he identifies with.But how can one be convinced that he is loved? This is such an old topic that talking about it could be boring. But do we really understand it? In my own observation, we may know about this in theory but rarely can we practice it effectively.Obviously, being loved as a target of desire is flattering since it’s a response to, and a kind of approval of, a person based on his merits. Some people’s love is conditioned on whether their loved ones can maintain these merits and consequently it is egocentric. More often than not, the admiration of a person will evolve into a concern over their well-being, such that we would care about the pain and suffering of those we love. Over time, we grow attached to them. We worry about them, miss them, think about them, be happy for them, cheer for them, and encourage them when they stumble. Our love will gradually mature from being egocentric to altruistic, from being demanding to nurturing. Barrier…Having many, many fans, one would think that Hua Hua must have already attained his happiness by being the center of so many people’s attention and desire, and certainly a lot of fans love him as dearly as a family member. However, in the first half of the “Conversations With Children of Mars” MV, we see a metaphorical scene in which he is alone in a cave while his fans are separated from him and gazing on him from behind a transparent barrier. In the cave, the environment is dark and gloomy and Hua is confused and in pain. I can’t help wondering if this barrier has been imposed by himself, by Martians, or by both? Do you know about my pain?We do know that even among loving family members if there is a lack of mutual understanding, there is often a chasm between the giving end and the receiving end. If you are concerned about the well-being of those you love, but you don’t understand their vulnerability or their fear and you stay ignorant of their pain, then you may deeply offend their sense of dignity. They may feel that you have reduced their whole person to a few merits that please you and are of value to you. They may also feel that you project your own views of what is good and bad onto them and ignore their interests and needs. In all of these cases, no matter how strong your love is, it will drag down your loved ones like a burden rather than nurture them to be a better version of themselves.Of course, sometimes, the barrier is not entirely our fault. After all, we can’t even understand ourselves completely let alone another person. So it is necessary to communicate with each other. We see that Hua Hua has decided to open up to let us know about his happiness, anger, sadness, and joy so that we can have a chance to understand his inner struggles. It’s not just a conversation with Martians, but also a plea for understanding. An appeal for the beautiful, which hasn’t been accorded for some time but is “finally favored”.“I am no longer silent because you choose to understand me”– I think Hua’s line of lyrics is the essence of the whole song. To love is to understand. The effort in trying to understand another human being is the ultimate respect and love that we can offer. It’s about taking a person for what he is on the whole instead of distorting him to fit him into our narratives in order to please ourselves. Only through understanding, can we offer unconditional support to those we love. You have brought light into my worldBy calling out for understanding, Hua Hua bravely walks out of his cave and reconciles with that lonely and battered self treading water, who wants love yet can’t open himself up and who rejects people who come too close. “Martian Children” then reach out to him and reflect light into his world by holding up a mirror, and subsequently, his world is depicted in a warmer tone in the second half of the music video. Children’s view of the world is not tainted by ideasHere I have to bring up the metaphor in the song title. He calls it “Conversations With Martian Children”. Obviously, most Martians are not children but adults. However, only a pure and childlike mind can be observant and can take in a person in his totality. Therefore, by addressing Martians as children, he is calling out for the kind of understanding which is prejudice-free and only conceivable by a childlike mind. Reconcile with oneselfThis is indeed a first step towards the ideal of universal love. We have to reach out for mutual understanding if we want the chance to love and to be loved. Maybe most people still can’t understand each other, but there are always some who can. In sharing our own vulnerabilities, we allow other people to find resonance and strength in our struggles, and in the process, we start to look at each other as real human beings instead of being defined as a few ideas which we may or may not like. The MVHua Chenyu invited fans of all ages and identities to sit down and chat, and organized the chat content into lyrics. This communication process was also recorded as a MV.This MV is produced with a warm and healing style. It records the subtle changes of Hua Chenyu’s feelings inside. With the heartwarming accompany of Martians, he has become a stronger self from being seclusive and self-centered to gradually being open. This song is not only a gift to his fans but more so communication with people who love his music. They are experiencing the warmth from each other in this unique time and space. The healing power to both sides is the most touching.In the completed MV, Hua and his fans asked each other questions and wrote what they wanted to say to each other: Hua: If I ask you to use a word to describe me, what will occur to you?ET: Light and darkness are also in my heartEven superman could get tired. It doesn’t matterFeeling vulnerable occasionally is normalHua: I want to compose a song with everybody togetherIt’s a song about…us“Thank you” 2. VideosListen OnlineSpotify MV Mars Concert 2019 3.

About the songHua mentioned that “God Tree” and “Arrival (降临)“ represent Yin and Yang respectively. They symbolize the conflicting, yet balancing factors whose cyclic interactions determine the flourish and decay of all things in this world. While in appearance we can simply take “Arrival“ as the arrival of new lives and “God Tree” as the destruction of them, as Hua Hua himself explained, beneath there is more. We won’t blame the Singer 2020 audience who ranked these songs relatively low. One critic even said that Hua didn’t quite bring out the emotions in “Arrival“. There is no denying that “Arrival“ and “God Tree” fall outside the general sensibility in content although, in terms of their melodies, they are still very appealing and refreshing. So, what are the underlying emotions in “Arrival“ and “God Tree” that the audience may have missed? Needless to say, there is peace, sadness, bravery, fear, and determination. However, if I were to pick out one hidden, yet prominent emotion, then it’s the sense of helplessness: the despair of seeing masses of people walking toward their doom, yet there is nothing you can do to stop the tragedy, no matter how loudly you scream. Hua Hua has explained it well in an interview: – When I see myself as tiny, it broadens my perspective. Then, I can see many different things which I care a lot about. For example, nature. Many people don’t care about it as long as they are not the ones who are hurt. But actually, it’s not like that. When many things get destroyed in nature, it may not affect you right now, yet it may affect you in the future because there is a cascading effect. So “God Tree” is talking about this effect. I am quite alright with the low ranking of the song. Perhaps people want to listen to music that’s close to what’s in their hearts right now. “God Tree” and “Arrival“ are not competitive songs. Within the short time frame of one song, it’s quite impossible that the audience would be shocked. We can see that Hua Hua is very conscious that these two songs are far away from the heart of the audience right now. While he is always gentle in his manner in interviews, his performance of “God Tree” revealed that his attitude would contradict that. He is screaming and shouting in flashing lightning and deafening thunder. The sense of urgency and helplessness are tearing his world apart. This helplessness comes from the realization that the deafness of people is the result of entrapped minds that can’t see the invisible chains they unconsciously impose on themselves. To warn these minds about their predicament is tantamount to telling them that they are believing in transient and undependable relics of truth from the past. Most adults in this world are so sure of their beliefs and it’s hard to even nudge them a little bit outside of their comfort zone. So, under normal circumstances, such warnings would be swept away quickly. It takes courage to open up about it as Hua Hua did. I noticed that although he is fully aware that these songs may not strike a chord with the audience, at the end of his interview, he still defiantly asks the audience to “please carefully savor these two songs and many different things may appear”. Naturally, we want to ask: What could have caused this entrapment of the mind, and why is the song titled “God Tree”? For that we can refer to the metaphors from the mythological stories mentioned in “Arrival“ and even the Japanese anime series, Naruto, in which there is a God Tree that was created partially based on the story of Adam and Eve. The haphazardness of knowledge is the common theme of these creation mythologies. Knowledge has a high status in our minds because without it we would have been living in the constant flux of contingent events of the phenomenal world. We would have never been able to grasp the laws of this world and make any progress. However, no matter how valid knowledge was at the time of its creation, knowledge is categorically the knowledge of the past, the bygone world of yesterdays. While some ideas of knowledge are science-based discoveries of the universal laws which are still applicable to the foreseeable future, a lot of others, especially in the form of ideologies, are unscrupulously accepted from habits and conventions which are out of sync with the reality of the here and now. Our attachment to our knowledge traps us in the past and sets limitations to our perceptions. The God Tree that Hua sings about is the knowledge tree in Paradise which seems to have nourished the world for a long time, but in reality, it’s sucking away its vitality. Such is the force of death: our ineptness to see what we are doing to the environment, our lag in cognition to its dangers, is all due to our attachment to our “old ways”, which is bringing, and will bring, more disasters. In contrast, the force of life is the constant renewal of knowledge. In “Arrival“, we see that the start of this renewal process is alluded to by the returning of the apple (the fruit from the tree of knowledge) to Paradise, the place where knowledge was first born and where the judgment of good or bad does not exist. In addition, the end of this renewal process is alluded to in the lyrics by the descent from Paradise with “new sprouts”. If we make a connection between the knowledge tree and the new sprout, then it’s apparent that this “new sprout” is a metaphor for renewed knowledge. I might add that knowledge from Paradise has more importance than that from our common understanding, because it is not derived from a place with presumed judgments, thus it’s prejudice-free. But to return to Paradise is difficult given that we have been living in a world full of judgments for so long. That gulf between Paradise and our world is almost insurmountable. How could we suspend judgments even briefly? We live in a judgmental world. To take action, we have to make quick decisions based on our knowledge. Can we halt our actions even briefly so that we don’t have to judge for a while? The renewal of knowledge requires the action-free tranquility expressed in “Arrival“ in its melody. But where on earth can we find that tranquility, the true tranquility which is not tainted by ideas from the past at all? Such tranquility is not possible unless we actively and purposefully seek it with the correct method. This helplessness is subtly expressed in “Arrival“ when he sings that “secrets are revealed too much, too much, and Narcissus can scarcely hold back his tears”. Why is the revelation of secrets sad? It’s because the secret matters a lot and yet if you tell people about it, the hope of being understood is slim. It is all the more moving considering how conscious Hua and his lyricist are aware of this reality. The dialectics between life and death, or the renewal of knowledge and the attachment to old knowledge, are the two coexisting, breathing forces that move our fates along their interplays. In the words of Hua Hua’s most recent interview: “‘Arrival‘ and ‘God Tree’ can be viewed as the rotational forces in Tai-Chi (the core symbol of Taoism).” Being dialectical means that none of the opposing forces will be judged as bad. Both are indispensable components of a vibrant system. Without knowledge, we won’t have any certainty of the laws behind the phenomenal world and we will be unable to make any progress. However, without casting old knowledge away, we cannot adapt to the constantly changing environment. The old idea from the east is that when one of the balancing factors, Yin or Yang, overwhelms the other, then evil arises. It requires our consciousness to keep these opposing factors in check. If we stay ignorant of them, we can never hope to escape from their ruthless hands. Therefore, as expressed in “God Tree”, no matter how slim the chance is, we will “never give up, never give up”. 2.

About the song“God Tree“ and “Arrival” respectively symbolize destruction and rebirth. They are mirrors and oppose each other. The two songs aim to explore the possibility of harmonious coexistence between man and nature and regain the original respect and awe of life. “Arrival” combines the five-tone melody mode with the lyrics of Western imagery to show the new national style of music. The repeated singing of “La vi ah vi ah vi” creates a peaceful atmosphere of renewal of all things and new shoots descending. It is a pious way of rebirth and blessings and conveys a heart of forgiveness towards everything. 2. VideosListen OnlineSpotify Mars Concert 2019 “Singer 2020” EP7 3.

And on March 27, 2020, Hua enthusiastically sang this new song on EP8 of “Singer 2020“. Composed on the eve of Hua Chenyu’s sixth anniversary of his debut, “New World” is the title song of Hua Chenyu’s 4th album and comprises of the summarization of his first five years in the music industry, signifying his entering into a higher stage. This magnificent composition is the distillation of Hua Chenyu’s unique understanding of music and the world captured through his eyes. The lyrics convey a sense of transcending beyond the struggles and victories in life; of standing alone at the summit after the arduous climb. The melody presents the complex relationship between sensibility and rationality, the unyielding resolve after the strike of an epiphany, and the uninhibition that defies all and yet encompasses all. It is worth mentioning that in “New World” we hear Hua Chenyu’s first incorporation of the imitation of Xun by the human voice. Xun (埙) is one of the oldest wind instruments in China, it makes a pure, reverberating sound that can be soft or rich. Hua Chenyu used his vocals to mimic Xun to allude to breaking free of a confining cage, defiant and unafraid to soar to heights unexplored. The vocalize building layer upon layer shines through unseeing fog to discover a path, the storm of quick rapping hammers on the heart, and his singing voice catches hold of you and brings you rising to meld into the galaxy. Through his music, Hua Chenyu blazes the way to a wild and open-world beyond your imagination, a conception with its every fiber formed from his artistic insights to the world and the self. 2.

Be included in Hua Chenyu’s 4th album “NEW WORLD“. 1. About the songThe song continues the popular rap with progressive reinforced rap and some Rock, criticizing the false and contradictory lifestyle of the real society in the name of “boring people”(“I’m Boring”). Hua Chenyu’s rap style. This is the 27-year-old Hua Chenyu wrote to his own advanced life Flow! When the boring man sings boring music, he returns to realism and criticizes without any concern. Abandoning the vicious attitude of a hothead, the naked clamoring chanting, the change of multiple timbre and span of the tone, let the original gray emotions of life be vented. “With the growth of age, under the pressure of life, many people see through the powerless and self-willed reality, survival, and hypocrisy of the fittest and greet, there will be a feeling of being unable to keep up. I wrote this song to see what would happen if there is no one around. “This is 27-year-old Hua Chenyu who wrote about his own advanced life Flow. “I’m Boring” vents the gray emotions of life to the fullest. “How many people are able to understand the emptiness in their hearts, they just live in the moment till they die.” “Surely a fool is happy to consume his enthusiasm, and you can earn probation of splattering if you play a stupid play. Afraid of being caught but haven’t yet. It is the stimulus you always seek.” The lyrics lively dissect the truth you already know but avoid to mention, and criticize the absurd and hypocritical “adult world” from the perspective of a bystander. “I’m Boring” was named by Hua Chenyu personally. The change of multiple timbre and range of spans inherited his unique popular hard-core rap style. The lyrics exhaled the original gray emotions of life. Zheng Nan’s way of merging the style brings unlimited development opportunities for Hua Chenyu’s rap and the cooperation between the two created a fresh and strong sense for the audience. 2.

Be included in Hua Chenyu’s 4th album “NEW WORLD“.Theme song of the character “Luban No.7” in the game “Honor of Kings”. 1. About the song“I was watching the movie ‘Deadpool’ at the time, and I felt very similar to Luban No.7’s slogan “IQ 250, worship, remember to worship” between his cheap and slutty character, so I combined these two characters and wrote it. A relaxing and enjoyable piece of music that can make people shake their heads and listen to addictive music. “Hua Chenyu tried the exotic reggae style for the first time, paying more attention to the smoothness of the melody, both lyricism and narrative. The “realistic” verse part is like a “stabilizer”, and the “magic” rap part is like an “accelerator”. The simple and repeated melody and lyrics of section A of the song directly lay out the theme “The world is too mediocre and I have no friends. I am straightforward and unpretentious, hiding my lifelong pursuit.” In sections A2-A4, Hua Chenyu also deliberately sang the electronic voice of the game character. The singing style; the B section is naughty, the jumping and catchy rhythm and the sense of speed and fun brought by acceleration make you can’t help but shake your head together, the interlude and C section unexpectedly use a marching snare drum The performance of the honor guard-style memorial and the ceremonial chorus heightened the passion of “the IQ can harvest the pride and arrogance of the whole audience at will”. The sense of game brought by the plot consumption of classic images makes you unable to stop, and you completely fall into Hua Chenyu’s ghostly “invented trap”. Zheng Nan brought a complete framework and freshness to this song from the arrangement point of view. The use of many distinctive orchestrations, such as piano, snare drum, choir, and electronic music changes, with clear and progressive layers, and finally the song ends abruptly with a “disharmonious” piano key sound, leaving the auditory challenge lingering. In unending excitement. 2. VideosGlory of Kings Third Anniversary Music Festival Hunan Spring Festival Gala 3.

Officially released on December 20, 2022.Be included in Hua Chenyu’s 5th album “Hope Forget“. 1. About the songMV was released on February 7, 2023, which is Hua Chenyu’s birthday. The English title of the MV song also took into account the meaning of “fly away, fly freely”, so “Fly Mode” was chosen. Hua Chenyu Writing About His Creation of “Airplane Mode” on Weibo: The reason I picked this song as the first one on the album is that I want to quickly convey the idea that this album is about everyday life. It is also a good way to start a journey between virtuality and reality. The whole song is very understandable by just looking at the lyrics, which are about working-class people in the current society.Whether it is due to the pressure of work, the pressure of family, or the pressure of personal life, whenever you want to relax after doing something, you may find that there will always be countless things waiting for you. Under this high pressure, many people have developed the habit of putting down their phones as the last thing to do before going to bed and picking up their phones to see if anyone has sent a message as the first thing to do in the morning after opening their eyes. You don’t know from whom you are waiting for a message, be it your lover, your boss, your friends, your family, or the layer of pressure in your heart.Have you ever noticed that if you wake up one day and pick up your phone, you may even feel a little lost if there is not a single message? In fact, people’s hearts are very strong, so most people can easily adapt themselves to a new way of survival, whether it’s good or bad. Even if it is a stressful life, many people can quickly adapt to it. But this is only the adaptation of the body and the living routines, yet in the depths of their inner world, it may bring some hidden negative emotions that they cannot detect themselves, and the venting of these negative emotions may hurt them or the people around who love them. Therefore, when we are adapting to the environment, we must learn to find a way to relieve mental stress. If we can occasionally turn on the “airplane mode” to empty our minds, take a break, and slow down, maybe we can find a little bit of ourselves in our own spiritual world.If you turn on the Airplane Mode for 10 minutes and it makes you anxious, then others have successfully changed you to live in a way that they imposed on you, and your heart is no longer under your own control. You will make yourself feel better by going out and taking breaks. I see many people call this song “the song of wage slaves”, I think there is nothing wrong with wage slaves. It depends on how you face the state of being a wage slave. In short, I hope everyone can find a better way to relieve stress after listening to this song!Let me talk about the creation of this song briefly. A few special things are that there are a lot more intermezzos in this song, and each paragraph is connected by a light intermezzo. I want to express the difficulties that working-class people face in a humorous way– the humor of them being tired obviously, yet they still have to maintain their pretty appearance in front of people. It took me a long time to find the right timbre for the intermezzo solo instrument at the end of the chorus. I tried a variety of crisp timbres, but they didn’t seem to express the humorous feeling I wanted, either it sounded too yuppieish, or it was too serious, or the notes were not jumpy enough. I later thought of a way to play it by using a very high bar chord on the bass, and then we applied some effects to the timbre. Then this crisp and somewhat heavy yet jumpy sense of humor came out. In addition, I added an instrument that I like very much, the Irish bagpipe, to make everyone feel that they are flying all over the world after listening to it. I remember the first time I released a short demo video on Weibo, everyone who listened to the chorus mistakenly thought that I had written a song about traveling in the mountains and grasslands and the sea. In fact, everyone got it right after listening to it, because I did want to convey the sense of traveling around the world when you close your eyes through this chorus. Another detail is that I used the 6345-chord progression in the first two choruses. In the last chorus, I changed the chord progression to 4165. Simply put, although they sound like the same melodies at first, I changed it from a minor to a major chord progression to make the last chorus more open and happier to the ear! 2.

She has actually helped me a lot.I have seen how painful she was.And…Yet, when she was in great despair.Gradually, she endured daily pain.Then she gradually let go of (pain).Then she liberated herself.Then she put away everything and returned to “emptiness” (A state of mind unattached to any materialistic concerns and emotional disturbances).So…Actually, when I saw her,It was also… to me…Actually…it wouldHow should I put it? It was spiritually encouraging to me.Because I feel tha every time, when she was in so much pain.She would still tell me a lot of philosophical wisdom about life.Let me relax a bit and feel less stressed.And…So, based on her guidance.I got this inspiration.I wrote this song.And in this song, I’ve used many…elements in Buddhist practiceIt’s like you have been walking in the desert.And you’ve been meditating about all kinds of bitterness and sweetness in life.Eventually, everything returns to “emptiness”.You may see a mirage (The flower in a small town is the mirage as explained by Hua Chenyu on Weibo).So the second new song for the concert.I gave it a very cute name. It’s called The Flower in a Small Town Later, in the variety show “Ace VS Ace (王牌对王牌)S7” EP6, Hua Chenyu explained in more detail that this song was written to his mother, who was hospitalized with a terminal illness and only had a few months left to live. Hua Chenyu Writing About His Creation of “Flowers in a Small Town” on Weibo: In fact, many people already know that this song is about a relative who passed away. The “flower” in it refers to my mother. I wrote this song last year because my mother passed away. The lyrics contain a lot of scenes about spiritual practice. The main reason is that about ten years ago, my mother suddenly told me that she wanted to become a Buddhist nun. In the past ten years, she often went to the temple to live for a long period of time to learn Buddhism and recite scriptures. Since then, whenever I was down, she would often enlighten me and help me out of confusion.My mother was not tall, she looked very petite and cute. I remember that when I was in kindergarten, a female classmate told me that my mother was very beautiful. I didn’t have a deep concept of beauty at the time, but I was pleased after listening to it. Since then, I have always thought that my mother is the most beautiful woman in the world, so there is the description of “gorgeous and delicate” in the lyrics. When I wrote this song, I always had a picture in my mind: A monk is walking hard against a sandstorm in a large desert, and then he sees a woman standing and dancing in the air far away in front of him. The monk walks towards the woman, but like a mirage, he can’t reach her no matter how he tries, he can only watch her from a distance. So there is the lyric “I can’t find her”, which means that the most beautiful flower will always bloom in the most suitable place. Although you will never be able to reach her, you can always appreciate the beauty that she brought to the world.Let’s briefly talk about the creation of this song. The song is one of my rare creations in the traditional Chinese style in the whole album. The harmony is also different from the previous harmonies I’ve used. In many places, the fourth-degree harmony is used to reflect a kind of Chan (Zen) vibe acoustically. In addition, in the second half, there is a low-pitched guitar timbre in a double-melody polyphony with my vocals, trying to reflect a sense of difficult steps brought about by the harsh environment on the road of spiritual practice. Furthermore, I designed a long solo for the ending and used a trumpet (in the folk music version, a Suona) for reflecting the tragic yet perseverant feeling of life when flowers bloom in a sea of fire. MV InterpretationThis MV transforms the concept of spiritual practice mentioned in the background introduction of Hua Chenyu’s “Flower in the Small Town” into visual imagery, creating a situation of “one flower, one world” from the Buddhist Avatamsaka Sutra. To present a tranquil and meditative fictional world in the MV, the production team did not choose the commonly known yellow desert, but instead chose a white desert with a clear blue sky, extending and developing the singer’s mental image as the central idea: a monk walks alone in an endless white desert, seemingly lost in a mirage. He sees a woman in red walking towards a giant stone relic symbolizing the small town, and the monk follows her through the heavy stones, thinking he has reached a dead end, but he discovers a wide and bright green oasis hidden behind the stones… The woman in red dances on a rock above the oasis, and her dance reflects on the monk’s face mask. The sunset and the arch-shaped stones are like a giant eye. As the rhythm of the dance changes, the sky undergoes a solar eclipse transformation, and the solar eclipse reflected on the monk’s face mask brings everything back to the beginning of the story in the desert, and the monk sets off again… Leaving a swaying carnation in the desert, beautiful yet fleeting. To be closer to the Buddhist concept of “the universe in a grain of sand,” the opening title of the “Flower in the Small Town” MV chose a design that shows dust gathering, and the handwritten lyrics express both emotions towards the singer’s mother and emotions in the details. The face of the monk in the mirror with no facial features represents that anyone can be a monk, and the world reflected in the face is what he imagines (appearance is generated from the mind). The main color scheme of the MV is dominated by blue and white, breaking the traditional image of ascetic monks. The video editing integrated Zen and aesthetics, and it echoes the broad worldview conveyed in the “Flower in the Small Town” song. 2.

About the songHua Chenyu sharing his creative inspiration at Mars Concert 2021, before releasing this song for the first time This year, I have written my new album.And today’s new songs…How should I put it?Actually, I feel that when I just started my career, I would often express my attitude towards life and music.So, when I first started, I wrote songs like “I Don’t Care“ and “Aliens“.Because when I saw some negative comments on the internet, I just felt that: “If you don’t like to listen to me, then just shut your ears.”I don’t care what you feel. Who cares?At the beginning, I felt that I needed to refute them a bit. Isn’t it so?Then some time after I started my career, I found: “Ha! This is a profession.” Isn’t that right?Professional slanderers.They absolutely won’t reason with you.They will simply slander you.When facing this kind of people, I understand that you don’t have to reason with them.Therefore, I mentioned that this year, all songs on the new album are related to everyday life.My first song, “Flight Mode“.As I’ve introduced it, sometimes as I would chat with my friends.Talk to strangers.Sometimes, I would listen to their stories.It seems that everybody is under high pressure.So, I wrote “Flight Mode“.It’s related to people around me.“Flowers in a Small Town“, It’s about a friend of mine.It’s about the guidance she has given to me, Which has allowed me to gain many understandings and insights.And the third song is written for the anti-fans.Now when I see those people who slander me on the internet, I won’t face them with the same attitude as in “I Don’t Care“ and “Aliens“.It’s because I have grown up.When I see them like this, I will only say …I won’t reason with them with an attitude.I may even forgive your ignorance.But I will laugh at you ten thousand times in my heart.So, after I sing this song today, when you encounter those so-called “professional anti-fans” on the internet again,Who purposefully incite fights online,Who intentionally make people argue,Please don’t argue with them on the internet.You also don’t have to reason with them.Just send this song to them and say: “Madam Old invites you to listen to a new song.” (Madam Old: Addresses oneself as a senior lady who is authoritative)This song is called “Black and White Artist”. Hua Chenyu Writing About His Creation of “Black and White Artist” on Weibo This song is written for the anti-fans. My simple introduction to it is that when you meet keyboard knights or similar unreasonable people around you who like to babble, you just need to say to him “Ah yes yes yes yes yes, you are right. If you say the earth is shaped like a square, then it is a square. Come on baby, keep working hard! 😊”. That’s pretty much what it means. You just have to savor it yourself. I won’t introduce much more about the creation. After all, the anti-fans think they are the most professional in any field, you just need to listen to their bragging. 2. VideosMars Concert 2021 3.

It was very comfortable.So I started riding my bike by myself a lot.To look around, yeah.And then I started liking this way of life.I would often go out alone.Take a walk, walk on the street, Have some food, Find a little bar and drink a bit.Sometimes I would go to a Japanese food place.By the night, all the guests would have left.The boss and I, just the two of us, would open a bottle of sake.We would sit there, talking and drinking all night.We actually didn’t know each other.But I felt it was kind of fun.And then, probably, probably.What I’ve told you may seem quite normal to a lot of people.It’s kind of a normal thing to do.Actually, what I’m trying to say is that.To me, this is very different.It actually changed the way of life I’d had since childhood.When I started to change my way of life.I started to feel like, This world is quite nice.So I slowly worked my way out of my struggles.I jumped out of it.I tried to live and live well.And I wrote down the state that I was in.Today, I want to sing this song.This is part two of my Healing Trilogy for Mars.At the same time, I want to share this song with people who may have had the same experience as me.I want you to know that,If you are like me,If you try a different way of life,Maybe it’ll ease your pain a little bit.So, next, the second part of the Healing Trilogy.I call it the “Hope Chapter”, I gave it a very romantic name.It’s called “We Meet When Flowers Fade”. 2.

We laughed togetherJoked together, teased each other, and we’ve felt sadness together and cried together.These are all wonderful memories for me.Also these six days make me feel that the future I have dreamed about and looked forward to has become a reality.It’s the same home as what I have dreamed about on Mars.The atmosphere is the same.People can come to this home to chat, listen to music and play games.You can also wear nice-looking and fun clothes according to your ideaIt’s all OK. You can even lay down and watch our concert. You can even play card games and mah-jong.It’s all OKThis is what I want. What the true Mars concert should look like.All these make me feel that it is worthwhile to write the third part of the trilogy.Next, I’m going to sing the last song of this year’s Mars Concert.It is also the last song of my Healing Trilogy.I call it the Future Chapter of Healing Trilogy.Well next, I hope that together with me.We will not leave any regret behind.Let’s have a healthy, bright, and positive Mars Concert.Won’t that be great?So for this song, I’ve given it a name that’s full of love.It’s called: “Let’s Go and Watch the Sunrise”. 2.

About the songOn February 22, 2023, the spring MV was officially released in collaboration with CCTV movie channel. In the warm season of spring, workers from all walks of life are beginning to set sail to welcome a new life. The warm and firm power of Chinese style is permeated in every detail. Let us immerse ourselves in the beauty and energy of life, let all things grow, gather hope, hard work and faith, and continue to flow upward in 2023. Hua Chenyu Writing About His Creation of “Growing Toward the Sun” and “Light the Bonfire at the end of the Milky Way” on Weibo The songs “Growing Toward the Sun” and “Light Up the Bonfire at the Galaxy’s End“ were written specifically for the concert, and they are supposed to be listened to after the Healing Trilogy. From the first struggling chapter, “I Really Want Myself Back (AKA Searching for Myself)“ to “Light Up the Bonfire at the Galaxy’s End“, which is the happiest and most romantic song on my entire album, these five songs can be listened to together. The reason why I wrote these two songs is that after I sang the last song “Let’s Go and Watch the Sunrise“ at the Mars Concert 2021, I have always dreamed that one day, I will be able to do a romantic and crazy thing with everyone, that is, we really have a concert to welcome the sunrise together. Then, I have always fantasized that there is a song that we can all sing together with warmth, full of hope and strength. We sing an ode to life together, sing sunshine together, and sing a song to welcome the feeling of the sunrise. “Growing toward the Sun” is a song about life that everyone can sing together. The beginning of the song is to pave the way for the description of the sky slowly becoming light, and then the feeling of everything awakening. At about 2:17 seconds, you can see the sunlight at the sea horizon or on distant mountain tops, and then at 2:45 seconds, “So radiant”, there is the feeling of the sun rising up from the sea horizon.After singing “Grow to follow the Sun”, it’s followed by “Light Up the Bonfire at the Galaxy’s End“. This song has already been released. In that song, we revel together, dance together, and imagine a better future together! The most difficult thing about this is thinking of a title for the song because I want to depict a lively scene, and I want everyone to feel romantic. So “bonfire” represents carnival, and “Milky Way (Galaxy)” represents romance because the Milky Way will remind us Queqiao (a bridge over the Milky Way in a fairy tale) where (lovers) meet at the end of the Milky Way once a year, eager to see each other! 2.

About the song Hua Chenyu writing about his creation of “Illusion and Reality”: The song “Illusion and Reality” is actually a summary of my album, and it is also my first attempt to use operatic techniques to compose.The content of this song is relatively complicated, so I started to sort out the long Weibo post a month ago, writing and deleting it in the middle, until I published this song today. It’s a bit long, and interested friends can take a look.The whole song is switching back and forth between “illusion” and “reality”, and the verses are mainly divided into three parts:The first part’s lyrics start from the very beginning till “that tenderness is not pretended”. This is written from the first-person perspective, and it talks about the self-contradictory state of understanding and not understanding the world through indoctrination during the growing-up process. Because when people are confused, they don’t know how to talk about their own life, or what appearance, expression, and language to use when facing different types of people, so it’s easy to start thinking about how to solve the conflicted feelings when they are alone.In terms of music, from the beginning of the first section, the bass and the harmonies appear and stop at the same time, and then the dry voice of a person stands out alone, just to highlight the effects of repeatedly switching between “illusion” and “reality”. When the person sings, the harmonies come in suddenly. It’s like when you are thinking about yourself, sometimes a lot of voices suddenly appear in your head to comfort you, but then they suddenly disappear.The second part is the rock chorus section in the middle. This section is more complicated. I may talk about its content while combining it with music. First of all, it’s narrated from the second-person perspective, that is, the perspective of others, the feeling that a bunch of people talking to you. From the word “pretended” at the end of the previous paragraph, the word “pretended” gradually changed from a normal human voice to a distorted human voice, and then to the appearance of an alarm-like sound that tells you that the “reality” is coming. But the distorted human voice is virtual, so it also highlights the question of whether is it reality or illusion. The whole paragraph roughly means that many people are using their moral standards to examine you and demand you, but in fact, they may not be able to meet these standards themselves. So the way the drums are played in the music part of this section has the feeling of a marching army. The chorus represents a group of people coming to tell you that the world is actually like this, it should be like this, and it must be like this. In fact, I struggled with how to record this chorus for a long time, because I wanted a feeling similar to marching. At first, I wanted to find a choir to record with bel canto, but then I felt that many old battle songs were not taught. People sing such songs to boost morale, so they don’t sing battle songs with the standard vocal method, instead, they will sing them while mimicking the feeling of bel canto. So it sounds free and the momentum will feel stronger. It’s hard to control this kind of semi-bel canto-like singing style. After repeated discussions with my producer, I came to the conclusion that only I can record this chorus by myself because only I know which kind of voice is the best. I probably altered my vocals and recorded nearly a hundred tracks to sing out this kind of chorus-like momentum, so it could sound like justice is about to come.The third part returns to a quiet part at the end, and this part has changed back to the first-person perspective, which roughly means that in the face of all this, I start to absorb what’s going on with myself, start to try slowly to resolve conflicts and accept all the good and the bad, and then keep moving forward, even if I may still encounter occasional setbacks in the middle and start to get confused and want to be saved. But life is such a process of constant repetition. As long as you are willing to accept it positively in your heart, you can live well.So many times what you think is real, the reality will tell you it is illusory, and what you think is illusory, the reality will be disguised so well that people still can’t find the answer. I am the same, I still do not know what the answer to life is, and I will struggle repeatedly, which may become my normal state in the future, but I still have to work hard to learn to accept the good and the bad.Many people like to use morality to restrain others, to teach you to do things from the highest ground of morality, and if they find out that you are wrong, they will rush to attack you and slander you as if they’ve grasped your lifeline. Can they represent justice? But those who attack you under the guise of justice may have made a mess in their own lives. So, sometimes you will fall into confusion, start to question life, and start to shrink back and escape. If everyone can truly lead a life by example while asking others, then this society may become more virtuous.We have learned to undo ignorance through higher education, but kindness can take a lifetime of life experience to gain. May each of us continue to learn to treat others with self-examination and kindness in our lives. 2. VideosMars Concert 2023 3.

The idea behind Size 40 was that a person really doesn’t need to take up too much space in the world. After all, you only have two feet, so you only need so much space to stand in. In true Hua Hua fashion, his sentiment is to just “go with the flow”; otherwise, there’s no need to make a big fuss. As long as you’re standing, your existence is valuable. Later, after receiving the lyrics for the song “Quasimodo’s Gift”, he changed his mind. He really liked the lyrics to the song, as they were true to the melody. This was the feeling he wanted for the album, so he decided to use the name of the song as the name of the album. He hoped everyone would learn to accept the negative things in life, even the ugliness we may encounter. Since everything has two sides, beauty may be hidden within those negative things. It’s just a matter of learning to see both the good and the bad.Among the ten songs on the album, three were Hua’s original compositions; “Why Nobody Fights”, “Let You Go”, and “Quasimodo’s Gift”. In addition to composing for this album, Hua also participated in the entire production of the album as well as selected the other seven songs from nearly 20,000 demos. All the songs chosen for this album are connected by the themes of thunder, rain, smoke, dew, light and dreams. The album was produced by Bernard Zheng and production lasted for nine months. Zheng arranged nine of the songs in rock and roll style and he also did the piano and guitar arrangements for the album. The copywriting for Hua Chenyu’s first album was prepared by Wu Mengzhi, now a director for Hunan TV. 卡西莫多的礼物 Quasimodo’s Gift Lyricist Composer 1 Why Nobody FightsMV Why Nobody Fights Hua Chenyu Hua Chenyu 2 微光 Glimmer Zhou Jieying Qian Lei 3 Let You Go Let You Go Xia Yuan Hua Chenyu 4 烟火里的尘埃MV Ashes from Fireworks Albert Leung Xi Lou 5 拆弹专家 Bomb Squad Zhao Zhisheng Dúné 6 环游 Traveling Nagatomo Chie MeiLiu Yuan Dúné 7 我们都是孤独的 We are all Lonely Dai Yuedong The Blue Van 8 不朽MV Immortal Guo Deziyi Dúné 9 卡西莫多的礼物Short Movie Quasimodo’s Gift Bei Zi Hua Chenyu 10 枕边故事 Bedside Story Dai Yuedong Ronald Tsui 2.

About the songIn 2015, Hua Chenyu wrote a song at home and named the demo “Karen Mok”. The two had not met yet but he felt that she was the only suitable candidate for the song. They would meet a year later at the filming of “The Next (天籁之战)“, with Mok being pleasantly surprised by Hua’s little shoutout to her character Bak Jing-jing in A Chinese Odyssey in the song “Great Sage Equal To Heaven (齐天大圣)“. This is how their story began, with two awe-inspiring talents admiring each other on one stage. Mok reached out to Hua in 2017 to write a song for her and he finally handed her the demo that was meant for her all along. She said that the song represents a special bond between them, they truly embody its essence of the “Half a Lifelong Romance”. Written by a fated companion and featuring her signature profound and emotional vocals, this song was included in Mok’s 25th Anniversary album. Despite their half a lifelong age gap, they seem to have known each other for a lifetime in this unbreakable bond. 2. VideosListen OnlineSpotify Karen Mok’s 2018 Chongqing concertFanCam 3.

OriginWhen first debuted, Hua Chenyu was often referred to as the “boy from Mars (火星弟弟)” by the media, due to his slightly strange personality.Hua simply made “MARS” his image symbol, and promised his fans that “someday we will return to Mars together.” To fulfill this promise, Hua named his personal concert “MARS CONCERT (火星演唱会).” By the way, His fans also received the nickname “ET (Martian，火星人)“. 2. Regular Parts of MARS CONCERT Greet fans with “Welcome home (欢迎回家)” as the first greeting. When performing the song “The World is a Zoo (世界是个动物园)“, Hua always sings “oiaioiaioiaiaio” with a random melody and makes his fans repeat it. The melody gradually becomes more complex, and it always ends on a high note that fans can’t sing, thus becoming a reason for Hua to laugh at his fans. Before the concert ends, be sure to thank each staff and partner, such as band members, company, security team, fire brigade, etc. Every time Hua pronounces a name, ETs shout “Thank you”. From 2014 to 2017, always sing Leslie Cheung’s famous song I Am What I Am (我) as the last encore. Since this is a very special song for Hua and he only has the strength to sing it once a year, he wanted to use that only opportunity for MARS CONCERT. In 2018, after singing I Am What I Am (我), Hua went on to sing an unreleased new song “New World (新世界)” and declared to fans, “From now on, I will take you to a new world.” Through this action, Hua embarked on a new journey in his life. Starting in 2021, MARS CONCERT has been upgraded to an outdoor rock festival. Hua put his rock songs in the more exciting Evening Show, and put his early songs and some pop songs in the more relaxed Matinee. Also, rearranging songs into unplugged version for Matinee and singing along with guest Zuo Li has become a regular occurrence. We don’t know since when, fans started asking Hua for kisses during impromptu interactions, and Hua always satisfied fans with a “kiss song” after a “brewing”. 3.

About the showThe program divides the contestants into three groups: the “Beauty Track (美颜赛道)” which focuses on appearance, the “Talent Track (独秀赛道)” which focuses on creative ability and the “Vocal Track (魔音赛道)” which focuses on vocal ability. Hua serves as the mentor of “Vocal Track”. In addition, the mentor for the “Beauty Track” is Yang Mi, a popular Chinese actress, and the mentor for the “Talent Track” is Joker Xue, a singer-songwriter who is good at writing lyrics. 2. Anecdote Later in the show, Hua cut his hair very short in another variety show “Flowers on Trip (旅途的花样)“. He was nicknamed “Shell-head Brother (壳哥)“ because his short hair was like a smooth eggshell. He shed tears while singing “Forest Polka” for the eliminated contestant Meng Zikun. In EP12, there is a part where the mentor and the contestant perform together. On the day of filming, although Hua Chenyu had a fever, he still performed two intense songs perfectly. After the performance, Hua had to lean on the host to stand firm. Also in EP12, Hua was filmed secretly cutting his nails with nail clippers. This was in preparation for playing the piano in a subsequent performance. The scene where Hua secretly picked up trash under the table after cutting his nails was also captured by fans on their mobile phones. Among the contestants, a virtual singer named HeZ was assigned to Hua Chenyu’s “Vocal Track”. The addition of virtual singers caused huge controversy in public opinion. Many viewers believed that the program production team lost fairness in pursuit of topicality. Because the mainstream public opinion ignored the virtual singer’s musical ability and directly denied the value of his existence, Hua felt very disappointed. When HeZ was eliminated, Hua shed tears again. 3.

About the showThis season, the contestants are divided into two groups: “START” and “RESTART” based on whether they have debuted before, and the number of mentors has also increased to six. As one of the six members, Hua pays more attention to vocal music and stage presence. Girl contestants will attain their “Strongest Brand Names” through constant progress. In addition to Hua Chenyu, the regular mentors include Stefanie Sun(a Singaporean female singer who can represent the Chinese music scene), Song Dandan (one of China’s top actresses/comedians), Long Danni (the most famous founder of China’s idol talent show), Mao Buyi (champion of “The Coming One Season 1“), Meng Meiqi (a member of the Chinese girl group “Rocket Girls 101” in 2018). Through tasks, practices, exams, the contestants will grow under the guidance of the mentors and eventually produce the “Strongest Brands.” 2. Anecdote The person who got this job was HCY148‘s new member “Sa Sa (飒飒)“. With his slightly curly short hair and charm like a comic book protagonist, he was called “飒飒” which means valiantly dashing. The opening performance was a rock song “Aliens“. Hua climbed onto the railing in front of the stands while singing. The all-girl audience became even more enthusiastic. Also during the opening performance, the opening song had to be re-shot because the fans’ chorus was too neat. Hua was ill again this season, but still taught the contestant how to play the drums handsomely despite his illness. 3.

Anecdote This season’s style is long curly hair tied up. Hua had a noble demeanor and a delicate vulnerability that earned him the nickname “Curly Hua (卷儿/卷鹅)“. The tears of “Curly Hua“ were called “Fairy sheds tears” by fans. During the live broadcast, Hua played with his sleeves and finally tied the two sleeves with a knot from the inside, tying himself up. In EP7, Hua’s track made a bet that if no one was eliminated, they would dance together. After the show, Hua led everyone to dance to the brainwashing Internet hit song “Next Door Tarzan” during a live broadcast. During the recording, there was a power outage due to weather. The fans in the audience took turns singing the mentors’ masterpieces. In EP8, Hua’s stomach hurt to the point where his eyesight went straight. But he still persisted until the end of the live broadcast. The children Hua took care of on the reality show “Let Go My Baby! (放开我北鼻)“ visited the backstage. Hua sang “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” to the children. 3.

About the song“The Next” (also known as “Sound of War”) is a singing competition/show where anyone can challenge mature singers.

Because every Chinese is very familiar with this melody, it is very difficult to adapt it. As a result, Hua Chenyu’s performance was a great success, and the song also became Hua’s signature work. Originally, due to copyright, it could not be performed outside of the show, but around 2018, Hua Chenyu removed the melody of “Yun Gong Xun Yin” from the prelude and also changed the middle chorus to his own original melody.The original melody is the chorus melody he composed for “Nunchucks (双截棍)“, which he covered on the Singing Talent Show Contest “Singer 2018“. 2.

About the show“The Next” (also known as “Sound of War”) is a singing competition/show where anyone can challenge mature singers, and fight for dreams to reach the top. From the start of each episode, 7 ordinary people from all walks of life will choose a singer to challenge, and each singer warrior (singers) would choose to accept a single challenger. The song the challenger chose for the singer warrior will then be revealed, and the singer warrior must compete with their challenger by singing the chosen song. The singer warriors have 24 hours to rearrange to chosen songs, and after 24 hours, they will face their challengers on the stage with 400 audiences who would cast their votes to decide the winner. On average, the rearrangement of a song goes along the lines of choosing a style, composing a demo, rearranging, settling the music sheets, rehearsals, etc. This process usually takes 1 week, but in “The Next”, the time is shortened to only 24 hours, with 4 singer warriors sharing one music band. In the second half of the competition, each of the surviving challengers form a combination with a singer, and compete against other teams by performing together.In addition to Hua, singers also includes Karen Mok, Fei Yu-ching and Yang Kun. Hua Chenyu fully demonstrated his songwriting ability and singing ability on the show. Taking this show as an opportunity, Hua relied on his own strength to reverse the negative image imposed on him by the media in the past three years, and has become increasingly popular not only in mainland China, but also in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. Through the show, Hua formed deep friendships with three senior singers, Karen Mok, Fei Yu-ching and Yang Kun. 2.

Rest for one episode EP7: Great Sage Equal To Heaven (齐天大圣)Derived from the openning song of the Chinese TV drama “Journey to the West”, “Yun Gong Xun Yin (Vocal-less)”November 27, 2016 “Yun Gong Xun Yin” is a song without lyrics that everyone is familiar with in China, so the process of reorganizing it was extremely difficult. As a result, the performance was a great success, and the song also became Hua’s signature work.

About the show“The Next” (also known as “Sound of War”) is a singing competition/show where anyone can challenge mature singers, and fight for dreams to reach the top. From the start of each episode, 7 ordinary people from all walks of life will choose a singer to challenge, and each singer warrior (singers) would choose to accept a single challenger. The song the challenger chose for the singer warrior will then be revealed, and the singer warrior must compete with their challenger by singing the chosen song. The singer warriors have 24 hours to rearrange to chosen songs, and after 24 hours, they will face their challengers on the stage with 400 audiences who would cast their votes to decide the winner. On average, the rearrangement of a song goes along the lines of choosing a style, composing a demo, rearranging, settling the music sheets, rehearsals, etc. This process usually takes 1 week, but in “The Next”, the time is shortened to only 24 hours, with 4 singer warriors sharing one music band. In the second half of the competition, each of the surviving challengers form a combination with a singer, and compete against other teams by performing together. In addition to Hua, singers in the Season 2 also includes Karen Mok, Fei Yu-ching, Yang Kun and Jason Zhang. Karen Mok, whom Hua met in Season 1, asked Hua to compose for her new album. Coincidentally, a few years ago, Hua wrote down a DEMO suitable for Karen to sing and named it “Karen Mok”, so he gave the DEMO directly to Karen. The DEMO later became “Half a Lifelong Romance (半生缘)“, which is included in Karen’s new album.This was Hua’s first compose work for Others. 2.

Detailed information about each episode EP1: Maiden Of Alisan (阿里山的姑娘)Original Singer: QingshanOctober 15, 2017 In the first episode of Season 2, Hua Chenyu sang the Taiwanese folk song “Maiden Of Alisan” by adapting it to his own style. EP2: HEAVEN (天堂)Original Singer: TenggerOctober 29, 2017 Hua Chenyu adapted a Mongolian folk song that praised one’s hometown into a New Age style. EP3: The Phantom Lover (夜半歌声)Original Singer: Leslie CheungNovember 5, 2017 The recording of the show was on the second day of the “Mars Concert 2017“. Hua Chenyu suffered from severe tinnitus due to overwork, and even worried that “I might never be able to make music again in the future.”But he gave the song 100 percent respect. He did not make drastic changes, conveying all the emotions to the audience through just a piano and his voice. EP4: Endless Embrace (深情相拥)with Zhao YouqiaoOriginal Singer: Leslie Cheung ft Winnie HsinNovember 11, 2017 EP5: I’m Ugly, But I’m Very Gentle (我很丑可是我很温柔)Original Singer: Chief ChaoNovember 18, 2017 Hua Chenyu thinks of herself, “Although I’m not handsome, I’m not ugly either.” So in order to prevent the audience from focusing on his appearance, he chose to wear a black mask. EP6: Code Name Contra (代号魂斗罗)Derived from the theme melody of the game “Contra”November 25, 2017 Since there aren’t any instruments or vocals in the game’s MIDI soundtrack, it’s fair to say Hua Chenyu created an entirely new song in 24 hours rather than just rearranging it. EP7 No PerformanceDecember 2, 2017 Draw a bye. Rest for one episode EP8: Dad, I’m Home (爸，我回来了)Original Singer: Jay ChouDecember 9, 2017 The theme of this song is domestic violence, and Hua Chenyu perfectly played the image of a boy who suffered domestic violence in the form of the narration.After the show aired, many viewers who didn’t know the truth assumed that this was Hua’s real experience. EP9: Drunk As Lonely Hero (一人饮酒醉)December 16, 2017 “Drunk As Lonely Hero” is a representative work of the “喊麦 (shouting mic)” music category popular among Chinese folk. To put it simply, it is similar to rap freestyle.Hua Chenyu created a new song using Chinese classical music style, adding a poetic and beautiful melody to the original rap-like lyrics. EP10-11 No PerformanceDecember 23, 2017 Draw a bye.

What is HCY148?“HCY” = Hua Chenyu“148” means Hua Chenyu has 148 sides of personalities and music genres. 2. Member Introduction Demon King大魔王 (da4 mo2 wang2) 魔 (mo2) = demon王 (wang2) = king 魔（demon）in Chinese culture is a concept coming from Buddhism. It refers to various factors that hinder the attainment of enlightenment. There are four kinds of demons: the demon of five sensory organs, the demon of worries, the demon of emotions leading to early death and the demon of trying too hard to attain enlightenment.In the novel “Journey to The West”, the Big Demon King is Wu Kong, who is rebellious to the idea of being abstain from all emotions, desires, and sensory distractions. Consequently, he is the Big Demon King. Hua Hua is literally taking a stance by calling himself the “Big Demon King”. He is affirming these human characteristics as the basic fabric in our being just like Wu Kong.In HCY148, Demon King also refers to the state Hua Hua is in when he’s on stage. The gaze that changes once the music starts to play. The fierce stage presence that he exudes. The full immersion in his own world when performing a song.The Demon King was first unleashed during Super Boy 2013 Concert Tour in Hangzhou in the year 2014 when Hua Hua took off his signature black-rimmed glasses and caught everyone off guard with this whole new side of his.Since then, Demon King has been spotted from time to time be it during Mars Concert, music festival, commercial performance, etc. and continues to be one of the most frequently sighted HCY148. Mr. Vocalist主唱大人 Like the Demon King, Mr. Vocalist is a character full of superstar aura, but he puts more emphasis on musical attributes.Mr. Vocalist is what a rock star should be. When he stands on stage, he is invincible. By the way, the Demon King and the Mr. Vocalist are Hua Chenyu’s favorite members. Sweet Cutie (cutie pie)小可爱 A moe character that’s cuter than a three-year-old child. Dorky Orange呆橘 (dai1 ju2) This is Hua’s classic look when he first started his journey towards stardom under the public’s eyes.This look consists of a pair of black-rimmed glasses, bangs that covers his eyebrows, and a frequent wide grin.The word 橘(orange) comes from the incident where he ate quite a number of mandarin oranges while waiting for his turn during the first audition for “Super Boy 2013“. Hua ended up having stomach discomfort and was at the restroom when his turn came. Thus the famous scene where his contestant number “08042” was called repeatedly everywhere while looking for him.As for the word 呆(dorky) refers to the dorky and adorable side of Hua at that time. He used to avoid the camera as much as he could and often answered slowly in single word or short phrases during interviews. Even up until today, this adorkable Hua continues to capture many hearts with his dorky answers and adorable grin. Camera Hua一目大师 (yi1 mu4 da4 shi1) When Hua Chenyu takes a photo with one eye closed, he is known as the Camera Hua (一目大师), which means “single eye”Camera Hua’s birthday is July 20, 2017. On this day, Hua published several photos taken on the variety show “Flowers on Trip (旅途的花样)“ on Sina Weibo under the name “Camera Hua”From then on, Hua used the name “Camera Hua” every time he posted photography (except selfies) Shell-head Brother壳哥 (ke2 ge1) 壳 (ke2) means shell or case; 哥 (ge1) means elder brother.This name was given as it looked like an egg shell.The story of how Shell-head Brother came into being is quite funny. In “Flowers on Trip (旅途的花样)“ Episode 6, Hua Hua initially went to Er-jie’s room in search of facial mask. When he saw Lin Chi-ling trimming her hair, Hua became interested and mentioned that his bangs was getting too long.From there, things spiralled real fast and before he knew it, Hua was sitting obediently with a clean pot on his head while Lin Chi-ling and Er-jie were cutting his hair. The outcome? Shell-head Brother made his first appearance and HCY148 officially welcomed a new member into the fold.When Hua first saw his new haircut, he admitted that he did not expect it to be so short. However, this new hairstyle turned out to be much well-loved when he appeared in “The Coming One S1“ as it further accentuated his suave side.However, in 2018 just when Martians were getting used to seeing Fluffy Hua, Hua Hua suddenly announced in Weibo that he had cut his hair short again.And so, Shell-head Brother returned as Shell-head Brother 2.0 and took the Bird’s Nest (Beijing National Stadium) by storm with his Mars Concert for two consecutive days.After that, Shell-head Brother could also be seen in several other occasions such as “The Coming One S2“ and Zhuhai Shark Music Festival Flowers on Trip EP6, Hua's CUT Barcode Hua条形码 (tiao2 xing2 ma3) 条形码 means barcode.This hairstyle comes with wispy bangs that covers both eyes entirely, creating a curtain-like effect, which in turn looks like the parallel lines of a barcode.It was said that one day when Hua was preparing for an award ceremony, he told his stylist that he did not want his eyes to be seen by others on that day. So his stylist came up with this hairstyle to fulfil his request and so Barcode Hua was officially added into HCY148Barcode Hua can only be found in a few events in the year 2014 such as IQIYI Scream Night, Young Choice 2014, and Tomorrow’s Party.Barcode Hua’s well-known speech was during the award presentation of IQIYI Scream Night 2015: “Lastly, what I’d like to say to my fans is I know that you don’t care how many awards I’ve received, or how popular I am in the (entertainment) industry. So I’d like to say to you, today my health is great and my mood is great too. So please, take good care of yourselves.” Whiskers Hua须须 (xu1 xu1) 须 means whiskers and this name is derived from the whisker-like feelers of catfish.The “whisker-like” side bangs of Whisker Hua creates an innocent feel.Along with Curly Hua, Whiskers Hua is grouped as fairy-like HCYs as his ethereal beauty awed those who saw him.Whiskers Hua is well-known for his gentleness and childlike charms.However, behold! Though childlike and gentle as he looks, Whiskers Hua has proven that he can be fierce looking too once the music starts to play.Traces of Whiskers Hua can be found in quite a number of events and programmes in the year 2017 such as “Sing with Me“ Season 2, first few episodes of “Flowers on Trip (旅途的花样)“ Season 1, Mercedes Benz AMG 50th Anniversary, Sakura Muse Night and In - Music Concert.The most memorable music festivals of Whiskers Hua are B.I.G Carnival and Strawberry Music Festival in 2017Therefore unsurprisingly, a recent HCY148 poll has shown that Fairy-like Whiskers Hua is listed as one of the most popular and very much missed HCY148. Jiu Jiu揪揪 (jiu1 jiu1) The word 揪 means pull.This is because this hairstyle requires the hair to be pulled into a ponytail at the top of the head.Jiu Jiu made his first public appearance during the filming of “Flowers on Trip“ in 2017 when Hua’s bangs was too long for his liking. So he pulled his hair into a ponytail to get them out of his face.However, Jiu Jiu’s appearance was short-lived as it lasted only for a few episodes before it was cut in the famous pot-haircut-session in episode 6 of “Flowers on Trip“.One of Jiu Jiu’s famous incidents was when he accidentally dropped the watermelon that he was carrying on his way back to the hotel while attempting runway walk. Today, this “watermelon tragedy” remains as one of the funniest scenes in this travelling show. Little Explodo小炸 (xiao3 zha4) From about 2016 to 2017, Hua’s hair was a bit longer, but not as long as Whiskers Hua (须须). And on his head, there were a few sharp hairs, like the horns of a little devil.This look was called “Little Explodo” because it looked like he had been through a bomb explosion. Broccoli Hua西兰花 (xi1 lan2 hua1) 西兰花 means broccoli, and its last Chinese character is the same as Hua Hua’s “花”This name was given because of Hua’s curly round head that resembles the head of broccoli.This hairstyle also gives off a fragile feel, which in turn enhances Hua’s delicate features.Broccoli Hua appeared only a few times and is often lamented as one of the HCY148 that will no longer return.First unveiled at the music show “Hi Song“ in 2014Most well-known for his appearance at the Chinese Top 10 Music Awards on 28th March 2016 where he sang “King and Beggar“ with Aska Yang.Then in the year 2016, Broccoli Hua officially appeared in full form and was also seen in “Fresh Sunday” show. Maruko Hua丸总 (wan2 zong3) The word 丸 (wan2) originates from the name Maruko, the main character of a well-known Japanese anime and manga series Chibi Maruko Chan.The name was given due to the resemblance between Hua Hua’ straight bangs and Maruko’s when Maruko had a disastrous haircut in Episode 936The word 总 (zong3) means CEO, thus the literal meaning of 丸总 is CEO Maruko as Maruko Hua exudes a boss-like aura.Maruko Hua was first seen in “Singer 2018“ Episode 8 singing “Flammable and Explosive”.Not only so, Maruko Hua was also spotted on several occasions such as Let Go My Baby! Season 3 Episode 7 and 8 and Conde Nast Traveler magazine.Maruko Hua is often mistaken for Rong Rong and Curly Hua as these two HCY148 do look similar in some ways such as the hair length and the slightly curled hair.So when you’re in doubt and confused, just look out for straight bangs paired with long hair, that’s none other than Maruko Hua! Fluffy Hua绒绒 (rong2 rong2) 绒 means soft and fluffy / velvet.Fluffy Hua’s 1st official appearance was in his Weibo video post when he sang “Half a Lifelong Romance” as fan benefit for reaching 20 million followers.With the soft and fluffy hairstyle, one just couldn’t help having the urge of tousling his hair. This childlike and gentle Fluffy Hua evoked a lot of maternal instincts among Martians, thus gaining him many mama fans.Fluffy Hua mainly appeared in “The Coming One S2“ (starting from episode 6).The most adorable moment of Fluffy Hua was during Shanghai Zebra Music Festival. The shy smile after he entered at the wrong beat when he was singing “For Forever“ remains a dearly-loved scene among fellow Martians. Sa Sa飒飒 (sa4 sa4) Sa Sa is also known as 立风 (li4 feng1), which is a result of separating the character 飒 into two words.The word 飒 comes from the Chinese idiom - 英姿飒爽(ying1 zi1 sa4 shuang3) which means valiantly dashing.In a recent HCY148 popularity poll carried out in Weibo by fellow Martians, Sa Sa won the first place with 13,000 votes, indicating an overwhelming majority of the votes.Sa Sa was spotted in the year 2019 during Chengdu Bit &amp; Beat Fest (BBF), Shanghai Sun Music Festival and Qingdao Phoenix Music Festival. Not only so, Sa Sa also appeared in “The Coming One S3“, mesmerizing the audience with his charming looks.A particular cheeky incident of Sa Sa was when he responded to Martians’ request for him to trim his hair. In the video, he took out a pair of scissors and claimed that he’ll cut his hair. And…he did!! Just ONE single strand of hair. With the wide grin before he ended the video, it was mischievous Hua Hua indeed!In short, dashing Sa Sa is definitely the hearthrob of many Martians! After that, Hua became more and more sexy. Shi Ye十爷 (shi2 ye2) 十爷 means Master Ten.This nickname originates from 十辰于 (shi2 chen2 yu2), a name after removing the upper part of each Chinese character of his name 华晨宇, in correspond to his shaved head.Here’s the breakdown of each character: 华 - 化 = 十 晨 - 日 = 辰 宇 - 宀 = 于.The story behind this HCY148 is one where he kept his promise after failing to grab his own concert ticket for the third time.It all began when Hua tried to prove that his concert tickets were not that difficult to get as claimed by Martians. Confidently, he joined in the ticket-snatching fray but failed twice miserably. Before the third round of ticket sales, Hua pledged to shave his head should he return empty-handed for a third time. Finally when the day came, the story took an interesting twist when Hua admitted sheepishly on Weibo that he had overslept and missed the ticket sales. On October 26, Shi Ye first made his appearance in a selfie on Weibo, proving that he is a man true to his word and wowing everyone with his new look.Shi Ye’s first public appearance was during Tmall Double 11 Gala 2019, looking stunning in a silver windbreaker and beret.Shi Ye is also the one who held the “Mars Concert 2019“ in Haikou, taking everyone’s breath away with his manly presence.Today, on the 24th of July 2020, Hua surprised everyone when he revealed that Shi Ye is back in town again.Well, nothing is more appealing than a man who honors his words and this man is definitely Shi Ye. Curly Hua卷儿/卷鹅 (juan3 er2) 卷儿 is also known as 卷鹅 where the word 儿 (er2) is substituted by the word 鹅(e2) as they sound similar.卷 means curly where in this case, the hair tends to curl slightly at the end.Besides being one of the two fairy-like HCYs, Curly Hua is also loved for his aristocratic air especially in the 2018 Mars Concert trailer.Curly Hua made his official debut in “Singer 2018“ during the episode where he sang “Ordinary Path”.There are different types of hair styling for Curly Hua. At times, Hua will tie his hair up partially (in “Singer 2018“) and at times all up like a loose bun (in “The Coming One S2“ Episode 3).Another variation of Curly Hua is with the addition of single braids as seen at Running Shark Music Festival in 2019.A particular heartfelt moment of Curly Hua was when Curly Hua teared up in “The Coming One S2“ as he felt unfair for his team who got eliminated due to the unfair competition rules. It was called “Fairy sheds tears” by fans.In the year 2020, Curly Hua was crowned as King of the Singers, making him the first post-90s generation to earn this title and marking yet another milestone in Hua’s career path. Idiot智障障 (zhi4 zhang4 zhang4) Hua sometimes shows an expression that doesn’t look very smart.The reason is that he was so happy that he forgot to control his facial expressions.Fans joked: “We didn’t expect that it would be the Idiot who finally won the “Bird’s Nest” (Mars Concert 2018)! Congratulations to Idiot!” Stop Brother停哥 (ting2 ge1) After Mars Concert 2018, Hua was unable to rest even though he was in poor health and had to rush to perform in various locations.So fans went online to accuse Hua’s agency.When the situation gradually worsened and was on the verge of getting out of control, Hua posted the word “stop” on social media, and all fans immediately stopped accusing.On the same day, photos of Hua wearing a T-shirt with a pattern similar to a traffic stop sign were also taken by the media. Seagull Brother海鸥哥哥 (hai3 ou1 ge1 ge) In the lyrics of “Black and White Artist (黑白艺术家)“, Hua Chenyu compared anti-fans to ants and himself to a seagull, thus getting the name “Seagull Brother”. Eyebrow slit Hua断眉小华 (duan4 mei2 xiao3 hua2) Before Mars Concert 2021, Hua Chenyu released a promotional photo with eyebrow slit on SNS, and introduced himself as a new member of HCY148.When fans asked what this member’s name was, he answered, “Eyebrow slit Hua?”","link":"/hcy-148/"},{"title":"MARS CONCERT 2023 (First half)","text":"Time Location guest April 7th-9th Hangzhou Baima Lake Park Zuo Li April 30th - May 2nd Chengdu Open Air Music Park Zuo Li May 27th-28th Wuhan Garden Expo Park Zuo Li June 22th-24th Changsha Malanshan Yazui Park Zuo Li 1. Achievements In 2023, Hua Chenyu held a live tour around China in the style of a rock festival. The theme of this tour is to take fans to the great rivers and mountains of the motherland, and Hua even promised an all-night sunrise concert. In the first half of the year, there were a total of 11 days of performances in four cities: Hangzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan, and Changsha, and each day was still divided into Matinee and Evening Show, and the ticket price had not changed. The stage was also newly constructed and was even bigger than 2021. The stage for this tour was designed by the production team for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, and was expected to be the most expensive personal concert stage in China. The main stage was a 28m high “science fiction city” made up of giant art installations. By using mirrored single-transparent materials over a large area, the stage was completely integrated with the natural environment, and different magical effects appeared from different viewpoints and at different times. Sometimes it felt like a “mirage of the sea” and the stage has “disappeared”. At night, 10 sets of huge mobile devices could move in various directions using the cross tracks on the stage, dividing the stage into multiple spaces. Images and lighting were randomly refracted in different spaces made up of mirror surfaces, and different effects could be seen from different positions, creating an ever-changing effect. The “Planet” stage was like a “interstellar device” of the “Martian civilization”, and the extension platform connected to the main stage penetrated the audience seats as a “Martian civilization” corridor. These spatial structures were surrounded by giant ring devices that resemble planetary orbits. According to the intention of each song, the circular orbit could create laser shows, artificial snowfall and other romantic miracles. » Stage Design Photo Gallery « » Poster and Highlight Photo Gallery « 2. Anecdote “Mars Food Street” in each city on the tour selected local specialties for sale. Furthermore, since the Changsha concerts happened to be held on China’s traditional Dragon Boat Festival, two types of gift sets containing Zongzi or green bean cake were on sale for a limited time. Promotional posters for each city used the same photo, but the background featured landmark buildings of that city. A different sentence was printed each day on the long ribbon paper that was sprayed at the end of the performance: Translation Original Hangzhou Day1 Spring is warm and flowers are in bloom, welcome home! 春暖花开，欢迎回家！ Day2 The flowers are blooming,let’s go for an outing together! 花开了，一起去郊游吧！ Day3 Believe in Hope, Growing Toward the Sun! 相信希望，向阳而生！ Chengdu Day1 Landed Mars, welcome home! 火星降临，欢迎回家！ Day2 Fly to search for the red meteor! 飞吧 去寻觅 红色的流星！ Day3 After the dispersal,will you forget me! 散场后，会不会忘了我！ Wuhan Day1 Mars, We are Home! 火星，我们，回家啦！ Day2 Mars, let love grow, let us face the sun! 火星 让爱生长 让我们向阳！ Changsha Day1 ［Dreams］where it all begins ~♥ ［梦］开始的地方~♥ Day2 Let’s together find the most beautiful wishes 我们一起寻找到最漂亮的愿望 Day3 Mars, ten years,See you at the Bird’s Nest! 火星，十年，鸟巢见！ Hangzhou Concert A few days before Mars Concert 2021, Covid-19 suddenly broke out in Zhejiang, and fans there were either prohibited from entering the park or had to watch in designated quarantine areas. Therefore, Hua Chenyu arranged the first concert of this year’s tour in Hangzhou. It rained for 10 consecutive days in Hangzhou before the concert, but it happened to clear up during the three days of the concerts. The lawn, which cost tens of millions of yuan to install, turned into a quagmire due to the rain, but temporary vinyl boards were erected and shoe covers were properly distributed, and the quagmire could not stop the enthusiasm of over 100,000 fans. The vast open space once used to set up the concert stage was named “Mars Lawn” by fans and has been registered on Baidu Maps, China’s most commonly used map website. Even though six months have passed, fans still came to the lawn from time to time to look for “Mars ruins”, such as small watermelons grown from watermelon seeds left in the ground by the Mars Food Street. Fans also hid various small souvenirs on the lawn so that fans who visit later can enjoy a “treasure hunt.” » Hangzhou Concert Photo Gallery « Chengdu Concert Chengdu Open Air Music Park is the top open-air music performance venue and music-themed urban park in China. Encompassing an area of approximately 317,000 square meters, the park has the capacity to host open air concerts accommodating up to 40,000 spectators or semi-indoor concerts for 10,000 attendees. The Evening Show was scheduled to start at 19:30, but since Chengdu is located in the midwestern part of China and it gets dark late, Hua Chenyu delayed it by more than 30 minutes to get the best visual effect of the opening. » Chengdu Concert Photo Gallery « Wuhan Concert When rehearsing, there were heavy rains several times a day, and the weather forecast was full of rain, so the organizers and fans only took precautions against the rain. However, on the day of the concert, high temperatures of over 35 degrees hit, and many spectators became unwell. Hua Chenyu took urgent measures to prevent heatstroke, making the water sold free of charge, purchasing a lot of non-edible ice, crushing it and throwing it into various parts of the audience area, and releasing a large amount of dry ice. Hua Chenyu also announced that the start time of Matinee the next day would be postponed from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, but the repertoire would be not reduced. In other words, the only thing that would be reduced was Hua’s own rest time. That night, Hua urgently purchased multiple outdoor air-conditioning fans from other provinces, and installed them in the most densely populated infield area. During the evening show on the first day, in the park where the venue was located, only the concert area did not rain. The previous concerts in Hangzhou and Chengdu also went against the weather forecast, and the weather suddenly cleared up only during the performances. At the evening show the next day, Hua Chenyu admitted that Mars does indeed have mysterious powers. Hua then directly responded to the anti-fans’ slander, saying that perhaps he is loved by the sun because he wrote the song “Growing Toward the Sun (向阳而生)“ and that even the weather forecast can’t beat him. The next day at Matinee, Hua said “Welcome to China” while singing “My Skateboard Shoes 2016 (我的滑板鞋2016)“, which was the first time he publicly expressed his welcome to foreign fans. » Wuhan Concert Photo Gallery « Changsha Concert In the days leading up to the performance, it rained heavily several times almost every day. Furthermore, Hua Chenyu prayed for rain to cool off in his rehearsal vlog. As a result, all three days of performances were held in the rain. At Matinee, Hua performed under a transparent umbrella. The show started 30 minutes early because according to Changsha city regulations, performances must end at 9:30. As a result, the sky was still very bright during the first hour, so the visual effects of the stage and lasers were significantly reduced. The video that was played during the encore (looking back on the decade since debut and preview of the next Bird’s Nest concert) was a surprise prepared by the staff without telling Hua Chenyu. The video was narrated by He Jiong, the famous Chinese host, and the host of Hua’s debut show “Superboy 2013“ ten years ago. About an hour after the end of the final performance, Hua Chenyu suddenly started a live broadcast to reduce the “aftereffects of a concert” and chatted with fans while eating skewers. Zuo Li also joined in afterwards. They talked about stage sets, favorite costumes, and the birth of the most memorable moments in the concert. » Changsha Concert Photo Gallery « 3.

Just like during the Dragon Boat Festival, Hua Chenyu prepared mooncake gift sets limited to the Mid-Autumn Festival and sold them exclusively at festival stalls. At the Beijing concert, there was a bad guy trying to shoot him in the eye with a laser pointer. So, before the show started, audiences in Shanghai spotted several suspects and took them to police. But during the performance, a laser beam that hit his face was still captured on camera. » Shanghai Concert Photo Gallery « Nanjing Concert 10 years ago, a promise that “ choosing me was not a mistake “ was made on the “Superboy 2013“ live tour’s Nanjing concert. This time, Hua Chenyu returned to Nanjing and fulfilled that promise.

Before the encore of the final concert, a video clip was aired documenting how the idea for an all-night sunrise concert was conceived and developed. It has been officially announced that the sunrise concert will be held next spring on China’s northern coast during the flowering season. New song “Extraordinary Ordinary Life (普通到不普通的人生)“ released for the first time in “Mars Concert 2023 Guangzhou concert”, on December 2, 2023. It was officially released at 24:00 on the same day. This song inherited the refreshing style of his new song released at the “Mars Concert 2023 Shanghai concert”. Because the stadium is located in a university town and has a relatively low ceiling, large monitors set up on four sides of the top of the stage can be seen in many surrounding open spaces and dormitories. As a result, an unexpectedly large number of fans and passersby gathered in this “free area”. Hua Chenyu found out about this from SNS during a costume change, and in the next talk, he mentioned the fans outside and asked them to join in the chorus. » Guangzhou Concert Photo Gallery « 3.

About the song The original song brings negative emotions to the audience, expressing the regret and anger of young people who are in conflict with life for the first time. However, Hua Chenyu, wrapped in a red raincoat that is more dazzling than the flames, added layer-by-layer passionate melody and guitar solo from bass to treble to the song, giving the song a new interpretation and vitality. That is the voice of people who remain unwavering in the face of difficulties and still hold on to a glimmer of hope in desperate plight. However, the audience’s likes and dislikes of subversive adaptations were polarized. The song only ranked 5th, which was his lowest ranking since participating in the show. Later, he adapted the song again at the Mars Concert 2023, removing the rap that was mainly used to incite the audience’s emotions, and using a more magnificent chorus and accompaniment to complete an interpretation that was more in line with his personal aesthetics. 2.

Lu Yang planned to use cartoon characters that were both disgusting and cute to express cancer cells, but Hua Chenyu had different opinions. For Hua, cancer should never be colorful and cute, it is the source of endless pain to people. After full communication, Hua got the opportunity to sing impromptu in the exhibition hall. There are no lyrics because the melody alone is enough to express all the emotions. Hua consumes a huge amount of energy every time he sings this song. Therefore, Hua Chenyu only occasionally sang “Cancer” at his Mars Concert. Compose: Hua ChenyuCrossover Cooperation: LuYang 2. Listen OnlineSpotify 3.

About the songThe first time Hua Chenyu covered this song was at “Mars Concert 2016“ in Beijing. Since Hua already had cover experience, he found it not difficult when this song was selected as the designated track for EP9 of “The Next S1“. But during rehearsal, the director asked him to add coloratura to the interlude. As a result, although Hua said that he had never sung coloratura before and might not be good at it, he quickly mastered the coloratura skills. In the “Singer 2018” EP8, Hua Chenyu suddenly learned the news of the death of lyricist Shang Mengdi during rehearsal, so he urgently abandoned the rehearsed song and changed it to this song “Flammable and Explosive”. Although there was no time to rehearse, so the previous arrangement was almost copied completely, but the emotional explosion brought a strong auditory and visual shock to the audience. 2.

Both times he made subversive arrangements of the songs. 1. About the songFive years ago, in “Superboy 2013“, Hua Chenyu, who was still an amateur, stood barefoot on the stage and expressed this 90s song in the form of psychedelic rock. Five years later, Hua Chenyu adapted this song again and presented a shocking experimental music piece with a completely different atmosphere in “Singer 2018“, showing his growth. “Singer 2018” backstage interview (excerpt) A small child, the ones they need to be closest to are the ones that provide food to them. And these people are their parents.If the parents aren’t by their side for long periods of times, they will think that if they can’t even receive love from the people they trust the most, then it will be harder to receive love from others.All of these elements led me to a situation where although I really longed for someone to love me, but I will reject those around me at the same time. It’s actually really painful.When I first started composing, it was a way to relieve my feelingsStaying in my own room, crazily playing the piano and singing on and on.It felt good.But all my venting, I won’t let others listen to it.Because I’ve experienced it first hand, this self-contradiction, the self-struggle.I want to use my feelings at that time to express the emotions of the song. I can resonate with the lyrics of the song a lot, so I was in pain when rearranging this song, because I had to constantly recallthe unpleasant memories from before.I added a lot of shouts and screams, and the audience might feel slightly uncomfortable when they hear it. But the screaming represents the final struggles.Since there was no one cared for me, I needed to save myself.This singer told me that this way of expressing.But thankfully I was very lucky, and I received a lot of love later onsuch that I was able to jump out of that environment.So I used a reversed way to let the audience to attention to those around them in the same situation.You need to try and understand them.In their hearts, they might need someone to love them and care for them. 2.

About the song“Maiden Of Alisan” is the theme song of the 1949 movie “Happenings in Ali Shan (阿里山风云)”, which depicts the story of Taiwanese indigenous peoples called Gaoshan people. Because this song incorporates musical elements of the Gaoshan people, it is often mistaken for a traditional folk song of the Gaoshan people, but in fact it is not a true folk song. The composer and lyricist of the song were both involved in the production of the above-mentioned movie. They composed the song when they came to Taiwan from the mainland to film the movie. Later, the song became so popular that it was included in music textbooks on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and was covered by many famous singers. “Infinity and Beyond 2023” is a music program based on Taiwanese golden songs. Recordings were carried out in Changsha and Taipei at the same time, taking the time as a clue to comprehensively sort out the “Chinese Music Chronicle” with Taiwanese characteristics. Build bridges and bonds through literary and artistic works, continuously strengthen the common memory, emotion and consciousness of compatriots on both sides of the strait, and demonstrate the spiritual bond of Chinese culture. Its purpose is not only to invite young musicians to perform classic songs in today’s music style, but also to pass on famous songs to the new era and stimulate cultural exchanges. 2.
